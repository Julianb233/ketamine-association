# When Initial Treatment Fails: Optimization Strategies for Non-Responders

Despite ketamine's remarkable efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, approximately 30-50% of patients do not achieve adequate response to standard protocols. For practitioners, managing these non-responders presents both a clinical challenge and an ethical obligation. When patients have exhausted conventional options and placed hope in ketamine, treatment failure can be devastating. This article provides a systematic framework for optimizing treatment in non-responders, including dose adjustment strategies, alternative routes of administration, and clear criteria for when discontinuation is appropriate.

## Defining Non-Response

### Response Metrics and Thresholds

Before addressing optimization, practitioners must clearly define treatment outcomes:

**Response**: Typically defined as ≥50% reduction in depression severity from baseline, measured by MADRS or HAM-D.

**Partial Response**: 25-49% reduction in depression severity. These patients merit optimization efforts.

**Non-Response**: <25% reduction in depression severity after an adequate trial.

**Remission**: MADRS ≤10 or HAM-D ≤7. The ultimate treatment goal.

### What Constitutes an Adequate Trial?

Before concluding non-response, ensure an adequate trial has been conducted:

**Standard IV Ketamine Trial**:
- Minimum: 4-6 infusions at 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes
- Frequency: 2-3 times weekly
- Duration: 2-3 weeks
- Proper screening and preparation

**Standard Intranasal Esketamine Trial**:
- Minimum: 8 sessions over 4 weeks
- Appropriate dose escalation (56mg → 84mg)
- Proper administration technique

**Oral Ketamine Trial**:
- Minimum: 6-8 sessions
- Adequate bioavailability consideration
- Dose optimization

## Systematic Assessment of Non-Response

### Step 1: Verify Treatment Delivery

Before assuming biological non-response, confirm that treatment was delivered optimally:

**Technical Factors**:
- IV line placement and patency
- Correct dose calculation (actual vs. ideal body weight considerations)
- Appropriate infusion rate
- No significant interruptions

**Patient Factors**:
- Fasting status (for oral/intranasal)
- Concurrent medications (especially benzodiazepines)
- Caffeine intake before treatment
- Sleep quality prior to sessions

### Step 2: Reassess the Diagnosis

Non-response should prompt diagnostic reconsideration:

**Questions to Ask**:
- Is this truly major depression, or could it be:
  - Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)?
  - Depression secondary to medical condition?
  - Substance-induced mood disorder?
  - Personality disorder with depressive features?
  - Adjustment disorder?

- Are there unrecognized comorbidities?
  - PTSD
  - OCD
  - Autism spectrum disorder
  - Attention deficit disorder
  - Chronic pain syndromes

- Are there perpetuating factors?
  - Ongoing substance use
  - Untreated sleep disorder
  - Chronic medical illness
  - Medication side effects
  - Psychosocial stressors

### Step 3: Evaluate Concurrent Medications

Certain medications may interfere with ketamine response:

**Potentially Interfering Medications**:

| Medication Class | Concern | Action |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Benzodiazepines | May reduce antidepressant effect | Taper if possible; hold on treatment days |
| Lamotrigine | Theoretical glutamate interaction | Limited clinical evidence; monitor |
| Memantine | NMDA antagonist competition | Avoid concurrent use |
| Naltrexone | May block some ketamine effects | Hold 72 hours before treatment |
| Heavy opioid use | Cross-tolerance possible | Consider dose adjustment |

### Step 4: Assess Treatment Engagement

Ketamine works best as part of comprehensive care:

- Is the patient engaged in psychotherapy?
- Are they maintaining basic self-care (sleep, exercise, nutrition)?
- Is there family/social support?
- Are they adherent with other medications?
- What are their expectations and beliefs about treatment?

## Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dose Adjustment

#### Higher Dosing

For non-responders to standard 0.5 mg/kg dosing, dose escalation is a reasonable first step:

**Evidence Base**: Several studies suggest that higher doses may benefit some patients:
- Fava et al. (2020) found that doses up to 1.0 mg/kg were tolerated and showed trend toward improved efficacy in non-responders
- Lally et al. (2014) demonstrated that 0.75 mg/kg may be optimal for some patients

**Dose Escalation Protocol**:

```
Week 1-2 (Standard): 0.5 mg/kg × 4-6 infusions
    ↓ (If non-response)
Week 3: 0.6 mg/kg × 2 infusions
    ↓ (If tolerated without adequate response)
Week 4: 0.75 mg/kg × 2 infusions
    ↓ (If tolerated without adequate response)
Week 5: Consider 1.0 mg/kg (maximum) × 2 infusions
```

**Considerations for Higher Dosing**:
- Enhanced cardiovascular monitoring required
- More pronounced dissociation expected
- Longer recovery time (90-120 minutes)
- Increased staff supervision
- More detailed informed consent

#### Lower Dosing

Paradoxically, some non-responders may benefit from lower doses:

**Rationale**: High dissociation may overwhelm some patients, preventing therapeutic engagement. For patients with significant anxiety, trauma history, or dissociative symptoms, lower doses may be more effective.

**Low-Dose Protocol**:
- Initial: 0.3 mg/kg
- Titrate: 0.35-0.4 mg/kg
- Focus on tolerability and integration

### Strategy 2: Infusion Rate Modification

The rate of ketamine delivery affects both efficacy and tolerability:

**Faster Infusion (20-30 minutes)**:
- May produce more robust glutamate surge
- Higher peak concentrations
- More intense dissociation
- Consider for patients who tolerated standard rate without response

**Slower Infusion (50-60 minutes)**:
- More gradual onset
- Better tolerated
- May benefit anxious patients
- Consider for those with difficult dissociative experiences

**Extended Infusion (90-120 minutes)**:
- Used in some research protocols
- May provide more sustained NMDA blockade
- Limited comparative data
- Resource-intensive

### Strategy 3: Alternative Routes of Administration

If IV ketamine has failed, consider alternative routes:

#### Intranasal Esketamine (Spravato)

**When to Consider**:
- Patient prefers non-IV route
- Insurance coverage for Spravato
- True non-response to racemic IV ketamine

**Why It Might Work**:
- Esketamine has higher NMDA receptor affinity than R-ketamine
- Different pharmacokinetic profile
- Some patients respond preferentially to S-enantiomer

**Protocol After IV Failure**:
- Start at 56mg, escalate to 84mg by session 2
- Complete full 8-session induction
- Evaluate response before concluding non-response

#### Intramuscular Ketamine

**Advantages**:
- More predictable absorption than oral/sublingual
- No IV access issues
- Potentially different kinetic profile
- May be useful in patients with poor venous access

**Protocol**:
- Dose: 0.5-1.0 mg/kg IM
- Onset: 5-15 minutes
- Duration: Approximately 45-60 minutes
- Can be administered in deltoid or gluteal muscle

**Considerations**:
- Injection site discomfort
- Less precise control than IV
- May have more variable response

#### Sublingual/Oral Ketamine

**When to Consider**:
- Cost barriers to IV treatment
- Patient preference for home treatment
- Maintenance after initial IV response

**Bioavailability Challenges**:
- Sublingual: ~30% bioavailability
- Oral: ~17% bioavailability
- Higher doses needed for equivalent effect

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Ensure proper sublingual absorption (10+ minutes under tongue)
- Consider troches/lozenges for prolonged mucosal contact
- Higher doses (100-300mg sublingual equivalent)
- Combination with MAOIs for increased bioavailability (specialist only)

### Strategy 4: Extended Treatment Duration

Some patients require longer treatment courses:

**Extended Induction Protocol**:

```
Standard Phase (Weeks 1-3): 6 infusions over 2-3 weeks
    ↓ (If partial response or delayed trajectory)
Extended Phase (Weeks 4-6): Additional 4-6 infusions
    ↓ (If continued improvement)
Optimization Phase (Weeks 7-12): Twice weekly, then weekly tapering
```

**Evidence**: Some studies suggest that non-responders to 6 infusions may still respond with continued treatment. Evaluate trajectory rather than absolute response.

### Strategy 5: Combination and Augmentation Strategies

#### Lithium Augmentation

**Rationale**: Lithium enhances neuroplasticity and may have synergistic effects with ketamine through shared mechanisms (GSK-3 inhibition, BDNF enhancement).

**Protocol**:
- Add lithium 300-600mg daily
- Achieve therapeutic level (0.6-0.8 mEq/L)
- Continue ketamine treatment
- Evaluate over 4-6 weeks

**Evidence**: Preclinical and preliminary clinical data suggest enhanced and prolonged ketamine response with lithium augmentation.

#### Glutamate Modulators

**D-Cycloserine**:
- Partial NMDA agonist
- May enhance neuroplasticity
- Some evidence for augmenting ketamine effects
- Dose: 250mg prior to ketamine session

**Rapastinel and Related Compounds**:
- NMDA receptor modulators in development
- May enhance or extend ketamine effects
- Currently investigational

#### Psychedelic-Assisted Approaches

**Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP)**:
- Structured therapeutic protocol during ketamine experience
- May enhance integration and meaning-making
- Consider for psychologically-minded patients
- Requires trained therapist

### Strategy 6: Addressing Specific Subtypes

#### Anxious Depression

Patients with prominent anxiety may need modified approaches:
- Lower initial doses
- Slower infusions
- Anxiolytic environment optimization
- Pre-treatment anxiety management (without benzodiazepines)
- Consider adding hydroxyzine or gabapentin for procedural anxiety

#### Anhedonic Depression

Patients with predominant anhedonia may have different neurobiology:
- Consider higher doses
- Evaluate for reward system dysfunction
- Track anhedonia-specific measures (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale)
- Consider dopaminergic augmentation

#### Chronic Pain Comorbidity

For patients with depression and chronic pain:
- Longer infusion durations may benefit both conditions
- Consider series specifically targeting pain
- Coordinate with pain management
- Monitor both depression and pain outcomes

## Knowing When to Discontinue

### Criteria for Discontinuation

After exhausting reasonable optimization strategies, discontinuation is appropriate when:

**Clear Non-Response**:
- < 25% improvement after optimized trial (typically 8-12 infusions with optimization)
- No trajectory toward response
- No clinically meaningful improvement in function or quality of life

**Intolerable Side Effects**:
- Severe or prolonged dissociation
- Cardiovascular concerns
- Significant cognitive complaints
- Psychological distress during sessions

**Patient Preference**:
- Informed decision to stop
- Cost or access barriers
- Preference for alternative approaches

**Contraindications Emerging**:
- New medical conditions
- Substance use concerns
- Psychotic symptoms

### The Discontinuation Conversation

Having an honest conversation about treatment failure is essential:

**Key Elements**:
1. **Acknowledge the disappointment**: "I know this is not the outcome we hoped for."
2. **Review what was tried**: "We've given this a comprehensive trial."
3. **Explain the evidence**: "About 30-40% of patients don't respond to ketamine, even with optimization."
4. **Maintain hope**: "This doesn't mean you won't respond to other treatments."
5. **Provide next steps**: Discuss alternative approaches.

### Alternative Pathways After Ketamine Failure

For patients who don't respond to ketamine:

**Neuromodulation Options**:
- Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
- Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
- Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)
- Deep brain stimulation (investigational)

**Pharmacological Approaches**:
- MAOIs (often underutilized)
- Thyroid augmentation
- Novel antidepressants in development
- Psilocybin (where available)

**Psychotherapy Intensification**:
- Intensive outpatient programs
- Residential treatment
- Trauma-focused therapy if applicable

**Lifestyle Interventions**:
- Intensive exercise programs
- Dietary modification (Mediterranean, anti-inflammatory)
- Sleep optimization
- Social prescribing

## Documentation Requirements

### Documenting Non-Response

Thorough documentation protects patients and practitioners:

**Required Documentation**:
- Baseline severity and all outcome measures
- Details of each treatment session
- Side effects and tolerability
- Optimization attempts and rationale
- Patient engagement and adherence
- Discussion of continued treatment vs. discontinuation
- Informed consent for optimization approaches
- Final assessment and recommendations

### Reporting to Referring Providers

Clear communication with the referring provider should include:
- Summary of treatment course
- Response trajectory
- Optimization attempts
- Final outcome
- Recommendations for next steps
- Offer for ongoing collaboration

## Case Examples

### Case 1: Successful Optimization

**Patient**: 48-year-old man with treatment-resistant depression, failed multiple antidepressant trials and one course of ECT.

**Initial Course**: 6 infusions at 0.5 mg/kg with minimal dissociation and only 20% reduction in MADRS (36 → 29).

**Assessment**:
- Concurrent clonazepam 1mg twice daily identified
- Good diagnostic clarity (MDD confirmed)
- Engaged in therapy

**Optimization**:
1. Clonazepam tapered over 3 weeks (with appropriate support)
2. Dose increased to 0.75 mg/kg
3. Four additional infusions administered

**Outcome**: MADRS decreased to 14 (61% reduction). Patient achieved response and continued with maintenance protocol.

**Key Lesson**: Benzodiazepine interference was the primary barrier.

### Case 2: Route Change Success

**Patient**: 35-year-old woman with bipolar II depression, adequate mood stabilizer coverage.

**Initial Course**: 6 IV infusions at 0.5 mg/kg with excessive dissociation requiring prolonged recovery but only 30% improvement (MADRS 32 → 22).

**Assessment**:
- Profound dissociative experiences were distressing
- History of childhood trauma
- Otherwise appropriate candidate

**Optimization**:
1. Switched to intranasal esketamine
2. Started at 56mg, then 84mg
3. Less intense dissociation with intranasal route

**Outcome**: After 8 sessions of intranasal esketamine, MADRS decreased to 12. Patient achieved response with better tolerability.

**Key Lesson**: Different routes may suit different patients.

### Case 3: Appropriate Discontinuation

**Patient**: 52-year-old man with chronic depression since adolescence, multiple comorbidities including chronic pain and personality features.

**Initial Course**: 6 infusions with minimal response (28% improvement).

**Optimization Attempts**:
1. Dose escalation to 0.75 mg/kg - no additional benefit
2. Extended to 10 total infusions - plateau at 30% improvement
3. Lithium augmentation added - no additional benefit
4. Switched to intramuscular route - no change

**Assessment After Optimization**:
- 12 total treatments with comprehensive optimization
- Best response: 32% improvement
- Patient fatigued with treatment process
- Significant personality pathology limiting treatment engagement

**Decision**: Discontinue ketamine, transition to intensive psychotherapy with DBT components, continue mood stabilizer.

**Key Lesson**: Not all patients will respond, and recognizing this allows redirection to more appropriate treatments.

## Strategic Takeaways

1. **Define Response Clearly**: Use standardized measures and clear thresholds. Know whether you're dealing with non-response, partial response, or inadequate trial.

2. **Systematic Assessment First**: Before optimizing, verify treatment delivery, reassess diagnosis, review medications, and evaluate engagement. The "non-response" may have identifiable causes.

3. **Address Benzodiazepines**: Concurrent benzodiazepine use is one of the most common and modifiable factors in ketamine non-response. Taper when safely possible.

4. **Optimize Before Abandoning**: Most non-responders deserve optimization attempts including dose adjustment, rate modification, and potentially route change.

5. **Consider the Trajectory**: Some patients have delayed responses. Evaluate the trend, not just the endpoint.

6. **Know When to Stop**: After comprehensive optimization (typically 10-12 treatments with various strategies), accepting non-response is appropriate and ethical.

7. **Have the Conversation**: Honest, compassionate discussion of treatment failure is essential. Maintain hope while being realistic.

8. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation of the optimization process protects everyone and contributes to understanding which patients benefit from ketamine.

9. **Always Have a Next Step**: Never leave patients without a plan. Even when ketamine fails, alternative pathways exist.

10. **Learn from Each Case**: Track your optimization outcomes to refine your approach and contribute to the collective understanding of ketamine non-response.
