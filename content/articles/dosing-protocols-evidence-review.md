# Evidence-Based Dosing Protocols: A Comprehensive Review for Practitioners

The therapeutic application of ketamine for mood disorders, chronic pain, and other indications requires precise dosing strategies that balance efficacy with safety. As ketamine therapy continues to evolve, practitioners must stay current with evidence-based protocols while maintaining flexibility to adjust for individual patient needs. This comprehensive review synthesizes current research and clinical experience to provide actionable dosing guidance across administration routes.

## Understanding Ketamine Pharmacokinetics

Before establishing dosing protocols, practitioners must understand ketamine's pharmacokinetic profile. Ketamine is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: S-ketamine (esketamine) and R-ketamine, each with distinct pharmacological properties.

### Key Pharmacokinetic Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Clinical Relevance |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Bioavailability (IV) | 100% | Reference standard |
| Bioavailability (IM) | 93% | Near-complete absorption |
| Bioavailability (IN) | 25-50% | Variable, technique-dependent |
| Bioavailability (SL) | 20-30% | First-pass metabolism |
| Half-life | 2-3 hours | Duration of monitoring |
| Onset (IV) | 1-5 minutes | Rapid effect |
| Peak effect (IV) | 15-20 minutes | Timing of maximum dissociation |
| Duration (IV) | 45-90 minutes | Treatment session length |

Understanding these parameters helps practitioners predict onset, duration, and intensity of effects, enabling appropriate scheduling and monitoring protocols.

## Intravenous (IV) Dosing Protocols

Intravenous administration remains the most studied route for ketamine therapy, particularly for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and acute suicidal ideation.

### Standard IV Protocol for Depression

The landmark studies establishing ketamine's antidepressant efficacy utilized a standardized protocol that has become the clinical reference:

**Standard Dose**: 0.5 mg/kg infused over 40 minutes

This protocol, derived from Berman et al. (2000) and Zarate et al. (2006), produces plasma concentrations sufficient for NMDA receptor modulation while minimizing adverse effects.

### Dose Titration Strategies

#### Initial Treatment Phase

For treatment-naive patients, a conservative approach is recommended:

| Session | Dose (mg/kg) | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 0.5 | Establish baseline response |
| 2 | 0.5-0.6 | Adjust based on response/tolerability |
| 3-6 | 0.5-0.75 | Optimize within therapeutic window |

#### Dose Adjustments Based on Response

**Inadequate Response (PHQ-9 reduction <25%)**:
- Increase by 0.1 mg/kg increments
- Maximum recommended dose: 1.0 mg/kg
- Consider longer infusion duration (60-90 minutes)

**Excessive Dissociation or Side Effects**:
- Reduce by 0.1 mg/kg
- Extend infusion time to 60 minutes
- Consider adjunctive anxiolytic premedication

### IV Dosing for Chronic Pain

Pain indications often require different protocols than mood disorders:

**Low-Dose Protocol (Neuropathic Pain)**:
- 0.1-0.3 mg/kg over 30-60 minutes
- May repeat daily for 3-5 days

**Higher-Dose Protocol (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome)**:
- 0.5-1.0 mg/kg over 4 hours
- Some protocols utilize multi-day infusions
- Requires intensive monitoring

### Infusion Rate Considerations

The rate of infusion significantly impacts both efficacy and tolerability:

| Infusion Duration | Rate at 0.5 mg/kg | Clinical Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 40 minutes | 0.75 mg/kg/hr | Standard protocol |
| 60 minutes | 0.5 mg/kg/hr | Reduced dissociation |
| 90 minutes | 0.33 mg/kg/hr | High sensitivity patients |
| 2-4 hours | Variable | Pain protocols |

Slower infusion rates generally produce less intense dissociative experiences while maintaining antidepressant efficacy.

## Intramuscular (IM) Dosing Protocols

Intramuscular administration offers advantages in certain clinical settings, including rapid onset without IV access requirements and high bioavailability.

### Standard IM Protocol

**Depression/Anxiety**:
- Starting dose: 0.5 mg/kg
- Dose range: 0.5-1.0 mg/kg
- Onset: 5-15 minutes
- Duration: 60-90 minutes

### IM Dosing Considerations

The IM route produces a more rapid onset than IV infusion but less controllable pharmacokinetics:

**Advantages**:
- No IV access required
- Simplified administration
- Appropriate for outpatient settings
- Cost-effective

**Disadvantages**:
- Cannot titrate in real-time
- More variable absorption
- Injection site discomfort
- Less precise dose delivery

### IM Dose Adjustment Protocol

| Patient Factor | Adjustment | Rationale |
|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Elderly (>65) | Reduce 20-30% | Altered distribution |
| Obesity | Use IBW or ABW | Avoid overdosing |
| Opioid tolerance | May need increase | Cross-tolerance |
| Anxiety history | Start lower | Sensitivity to dissociation |

## Sublingual (SL) Dosing Protocols

Sublingual ketamine offers a non-invasive option suitable for at-home maintenance therapy under appropriate supervision protocols.

### Bioavailability Considerations

Sublingual bioavailability ranges from 20-30%, necessitating higher nominal doses:

**Dose Equivalence (approximate)**:
- 0.5 mg/kg IV ≈ 1.5-2.0 mg/kg SL
- Significant individual variation exists

### Standard SL Protocol

**Initial Dosing**:
- Starting dose: 50-100 mg
- Hold under tongue for 10-15 minutes
- Spit or swallow after dissolution

**Maintenance Dosing**:
- Range: 100-400 mg per session
- Frequency: 2-3 times weekly
- Titrate based on response

### SL Administration Technique

Proper technique significantly impacts bioavailability:

1. Patient should have dry mouth (no food/drink 30 minutes prior)
2. Place tablet/troche under tongue or in buccal space
3. Avoid swallowing saliva for 10-15 minutes
4. Minimize talking during dissolution
5. After 15 minutes, swallow or expectorate

### SL Formulation Options

| Formulation | Concentration | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Troches/Lozenges | 50-400 mg | Most common, compounded |
| RDT (rapid dissolving) | Variable | Faster dissolution |
| Solution | 100 mg/mL typical | Precise dosing |

## Intranasal (IN) Dosing Protocols

Intranasal delivery provides another non-invasive option, with FDA-approved esketamine (Spravato) representing the most studied IN protocol.

### Esketamine (Spravato) Protocol

**FDA-Approved Dosing**:
- Starting dose: 56 mg (two devices)
- May increase to 84 mg (three devices)
- Administration: twice weekly for 4 weeks, then weekly, then every 1-2 weeks

**Administration Requirements**:
- REMS program enrollment required
- 2-hour post-dose monitoring
- Healthcare setting only

### Racemic Ketamine IN Protocol

For compounded racemic ketamine intranasal:

**Dosing Range**:
- 20-100 mg per session
- Bioavailability: 25-50% (highly variable)

**Administration Technique**:
- Alternating nostrils
- 5-minute intervals between sprays
- Upright position, slight head tilt
- Avoid sniffing forcefully

### IN Dosing Challenges

Intranasal delivery presents unique challenges:

| Challenge | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Variable absorption | Inconsistent effect | Standardize technique |
| Nasal congestion | Reduced bioavailability | Assess nasal patency |
| Taste/drip | Patient discomfort | Education, positioning |
| Volume limitations | Dose ceiling | Multiple administrations |

## Patient-Specific Dose Adjustments

### Weight-Based Considerations

**Actual Body Weight (ABW) vs. Ideal Body Weight (IBW)**:

For patients with BMI > 30, consider using adjusted body weight:
- Adjusted BW = IBW + 0.4 × (ABW - IBW)

This approach prevents relative overdosing in obese patients while ensuring adequate dosing.

### Age-Related Adjustments

**Elderly Patients (>65 years)**:
- Reduce initial dose by 20-30%
- Expect prolonged duration of effects
- Monitor for cardiovascular effects more closely
- Cognitive effects may be more pronounced

**Younger Adults (18-25)**:
- Standard dosing generally appropriate
- May have faster metabolism
- Careful screening for substance use history

### Comorbidity Considerations

| Comorbidity | Adjustment | Monitoring |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Hypertension | Lower starting dose | Frequent BP checks |
| Hepatic impairment | Reduce by 25-50% | Extended monitoring |
| Renal impairment | Standard dosing | No adjustment needed |
| Cardiovascular disease | Case-by-case | Cardiology clearance |
| Substance use history | Careful assessment | Addiction specialist input |

### Tolerance and Treatment History

**Prior Ketamine Exposure**:
- Recreational history may indicate tolerance
- Previous therapeutic responders often maintain dose
- Non-responders may need dose escalation or route change

**Opioid Tolerance**:
- Cross-tolerance may exist at NMDA receptors
- May require 20-30% dose increase
- Monitor for reduced efficacy

### Medication Interactions

**Medications Requiring Dose Adjustment**:

| Medication Class | Interaction | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Benzodiazepines | May reduce efficacy | Avoid day of treatment |
| Lamotrigine | Possible synergy | Start with lower ketamine dose |
| MAOIs | Theoretical concern | 2-week washout recommended |
| CYP3A4 inhibitors | Increased ketamine levels | Reduce dose |
| CYP3A4 inducers | Decreased ketamine levels | May need increase |

## Dosing Protocols by Indication

### Treatment-Resistant Depression

**Induction Phase (Weeks 1-3)**:
- 0.5 mg/kg IV × 6 treatments over 2-3 weeks
- Or 56-84 mg IN esketamine twice weekly

**Maintenance Phase**:
- Weekly to every 2 weeks based on response
- Same dose as effective induction dose
- Consider SL for appropriate patients

### Acute Suicidal Ideation

**Emergency Department Protocol**:
- 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes
- May repeat once if needed
- Transition to outpatient care

### Chronic Pain Syndromes

**Neuropathic Pain**:
- 0.1-0.5 mg/kg IV over 30-60 minutes
- Series of 4-6 infusions
- Maintenance every 4-8 weeks

**CRPS**:
- Higher doses often required
- Multi-day protocols considered
- Specialized pain center recommended

### Anxiety Disorders

**Generalized/Social Anxiety**:
- Start at 0.3-0.4 mg/kg IV
- Titrate based on response
- Often effective at lower doses than depression

**PTSD**:
- Standard 0.5 mg/kg protocol
- Consider psychotherapy integration
- May need longer treatment courses

## Monitoring During Dose Administration

### Vital Sign Monitoring Protocol

| Timepoint | Parameters | Action Threshold |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Baseline | BP, HR, SpO2, RR | Document baseline |
| 15 min | BP, HR | SBP >180 or <90 |
| 30 min | BP, HR, SpO2 | HR >120 or <50 |
| 45 min | BP, HR | Any significant change |
| 60 min | BP, HR, SpO2 | Recovery to baseline |
| 90 min | BP, HR, mental status | Discharge readiness |

### Response Assessment Tools

**Depression**:
- PHQ-9 at baseline and post-series
- QIDS-SR for session-to-session tracking
- MADRS for research protocols

**Dissociation Monitoring**:
- CADSS (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale)
- Simple 0-10 dissociation scale for clinical use
- Staff observation

## Special Populations

### Pregnancy and Lactation

**Current Recommendations**:
- Avoid ketamine during pregnancy if possible
- Limited data on lactation; exercise caution
- Risk-benefit discussion essential
- Document informed consent thoroughly

### Pediatric Considerations

**Off-Label Use in Adolescents**:
- Limited evidence base
- Start at 50% of adult dose
- Parental consent and assent required
- Careful monitoring for emergence reactions

### Geriatric Population

**Modified Protocol**:
- Start at 0.3-0.4 mg/kg IV
- Extend infusion to 60 minutes
- Longer monitoring period (2-3 hours)
- Assess cognitive function post-treatment

## Documentation Requirements

### Pre-Treatment Documentation

- Indication and rationale
- Previous treatment history
- Contraindication screening
- Baseline vital signs and mental status
- Informed consent confirmation

### Treatment Session Documentation

- Exact dose administered (mg and mg/kg)
- Route and rate of administration
- Vital signs per protocol
- Subjective patient experience
- Adverse events and interventions
- Mental status at discharge

### Post-Series Documentation

- Treatment response (validated scales)
- Side effect summary
- Recommendation for maintenance
- Follow-up plan

## Clinical Takeaways

1. **Standard IV Protocol**: 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes remains the evidence-based starting point for depression, with adjustment range of 0.3-1.0 mg/kg based on response and tolerability.

2. **Route Selection Matters**: Choose administration route based on clinical setting, patient factors, monitoring capabilities, and treatment goals. IV offers most control; SL/IN enable maintenance strategies.

3. **Individualize Dosing**: Patient factors including age, weight, comorbidities, and medication interactions necessitate individualized dose adjustments. Start conservatively and titrate based on response.

4. **Monitor Systematically**: Establish standardized monitoring protocols for vital signs, dissociation, and treatment response. Documentation protects patients and practitioners.

5. **Evidence Continues to Evolve**: Stay current with emerging research on optimal dosing strategies, particularly for newer routes of administration and novel indications.

6. **Safety First**: When uncertain, err on the side of lower doses and slower titration. The goal is sustainable treatment response with minimal adverse effects.

7. **Consider Maintenance Early**: Plan for long-term management from the outset. Initial response must be supported by appropriate maintenance protocols.
