# Patient Screening and Assessment: Identifying Ideal Candidates for Ketamine Therapy

Proper patient selection is paramount to achieving optimal outcomes in ketamine therapy. While ketamine offers remarkable benefits for treatment-resistant conditions, not every patient is an appropriate candidate. This comprehensive guide provides practitioners with systematic approaches to screening, assessment, and medical clearance that maximize therapeutic benefit while ensuring patient safety.

## The Importance of Rigorous Screening

Ketamine therapy operates at the intersection of psychiatric treatment and procedural medicine. This dual nature demands comprehensive evaluation that addresses both mental health appropriateness and medical safety. A thorough screening process:

- Identifies patients most likely to benefit
- Excludes those at elevated risk for adverse outcomes
- Establishes baseline parameters for monitoring
- Documents medical necessity for treatment
- Supports informed consent discussions
- Protects both patient and practitioner

## Establishing Appropriate Indications

### Primary Indications with Strong Evidence

**Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)**

TRD represents the most established indication for ketamine therapy. Operational definitions vary, but generally include:

| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Failed trials | ≥2 adequate antidepressant trials |
| Adequate trial | Appropriate dose for ≥4-6 weeks |
| Current episode | Active moderate-severe depression |
| Documented trials | Medical records confirming history |

**Clinical Pearl**: Ensure "treatment resistance" is genuine by verifying adequate dosing, duration, and adherence to previous trials rather than accepting patient self-report alone.

**Acute Suicidal Ideation**

Ketamine's rapid-acting antisuicidal properties make it valuable for crisis intervention:

- Active suicidal ideation with intent or plan
- Emergency department presentations
- Bridge therapy during medication initiation
- Severe hopelessness unresponsive to acute interventions

### Secondary Indications with Moderate Evidence

**Anxiety Disorders**
- Generalized anxiety disorder
- Social anxiety disorder
- Treatment-resistant OCD (adjunctive)

**PTSD**
- Treatment-resistant PTSD
- Often combined with psychotherapy
- May facilitate trauma processing

**Chronic Pain Syndromes**
- Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)
- Fibromyalgia
- Neuropathic pain conditions
- Central sensitization syndromes

### Emerging Indications (Limited Evidence)

- Substance use disorders (alcohol, cocaine, opioids)
- Eating disorders
- Bipolar depression (with mood stabilizer)
- Postpartum depression

## Inclusion Criteria

### Psychiatric Criteria

**Required Elements**:

1. **Confirmed Diagnosis**: DSM-5 diagnosis confirmed by structured or semi-structured interview
2. **Severity Threshold**: Moderate to severe symptomatology
   - PHQ-9 ≥10 (moderate) or ≥15 (moderately severe)
   - MADRS ≥20
   - HAM-D ≥17
3. **Treatment History**: Documented failure of standard treatments
4. **Stability**: No acute psychiatric decompensation requiring higher level of care

**Favorable Prognostic Indicators**:

| Factor | Association with Response |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Family history of alcohol use disorder | Positive predictor |
| BMI > 25 | Some studies show positive correlation |
| Anxious depression subtype | May show enhanced response |
| Shorter current episode | Better outcomes |
| Fewer failed trials | Higher response rate |

### Medical Criteria

**Baseline Requirements**:

- Age 18-65 (standard); 16-75 (expanded with precautions)
- Medically stable without acute conditions
- Adequate hepatic function
- Controlled cardiovascular status
- No active substance intoxication

## Absolute Contraindications

Certain conditions represent non-negotiable exclusions due to unacceptable risk:

### Psychiatric Contraindications

**Active Psychosis**
- Current psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions)
- History of ketamine-induced psychosis
- Primary psychotic disorder (schizophrenia, schizoaffective)
- Delusional disorder

**Rationale**: Ketamine's pro-psychotomimetic effects can exacerbate psychotic symptoms and precipitate prolonged psychotic episodes.

**Uncontrolled Mania**
- Current manic or hypomanic episode
- Rapid cycling without mood stabilization
- Mixed features with psychotic symptoms

### Medical Contraindications

| Condition | Rationale | Considerations |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Uncontrolled hypertension | Sympathomimetic effects | SBP >180, DBP >100 |
| Unstable angina | Cardiovascular stress | Active symptoms |
| Recent MI (<3 months) | Cardiac risk | Case-by-case after |
| Severe hepatic failure | Impaired metabolism | Child-Pugh C |
| Intracranial hypertension | ICP elevation | Active hydrocephalus |
| Aneurysmal disease | Hypertensive risk | Unclipped/untreated |
| Active pregnancy | Fetal effects | First trimester absolute |
| Known ketamine allergy | Anaphylaxis risk | True allergy rare |

### Substance-Related Contraindications

**Active Substance Intoxication**
- Alcohol intoxication
- Stimulant intoxication
- Benzodiazepine intoxication
- Opioid intoxication (relative)

**Active Uncontrolled Addiction**
- Ketamine use disorder (absolute)
- Active PCP/dissociative use
- Active stimulant use disorder (relative)

## Relative Contraindications

Relative contraindications require careful risk-benefit analysis and may be managed with appropriate precautions:

### Cardiovascular Considerations

**Controlled Hypertension**
- Verify BP controlled on current regimen
- Ensure medications taken day of treatment
- More frequent BP monitoring during treatment
- Lower threshold for intervention

**Coronary Artery Disease (Stable)**
- Cardiology clearance recommended
- Optimize medical management pre-treatment
- Have cardiac emergency protocols ready
- Consider lower doses

**Arrhythmias**
- Baseline ECG recommended
- Avoid in uncontrolled arrhythmias
- Stable rate-controlled atrial fibrillation acceptable
- Prolonged QT requires specialist input

### Psychiatric Considerations

**History of Psychosis**
- Distinguish primary psychotic disorders (exclude) from secondary/substance-induced (case-by-case)
- Remote history of brief psychotic episode may not be absolute exclusion
- Requires experienced clinician oversight
- Consider lower doses and closer monitoring

**Personality Disorders**
- Not a contraindication per se
- May affect treatment milieu
- Assess for secondary gain dynamics
- Ensure appropriate support structures

**Dissociative Disorders**
- Careful assessment of dissociation history
- DID (dissociative identity disorder) requires specialized consideration
- May exacerbate dissociative symptoms
- Trauma-informed approach essential

**Active Suicidality Without Safe Discharge**
- Ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation but is not standalone treatment
- Requires comprehensive safety planning
- Ensure appropriate level of care available
- May need inpatient setting

### Medical Considerations

**Hepatic Impairment**
- Mild-moderate (Child-Pugh A/B): Proceed with dose reduction
- Severe (Child-Pugh C): Generally avoid
- Monitor for prolonged effects
- Increase observation period

**Glaucoma**
- Theoretically may increase intraocular pressure
- Limited clinical significance with standard doses
- Ophthalmology clearance for narrow-angle glaucoma
- Open-angle glaucoma not contraindication

**Hyperthyroidism**
- Uncontrolled: Postpone until treated
- Controlled: Proceed with monitoring
- Risk of hypertensive response enhanced

## Mental Health Screening Tools

- Enhanced monitoring protocols

## Clinical Takeaways

1. **Systematic Screening Saves Lives**: A comprehensive, standardized screening protocol identifies high-risk patients before treatment, preventing adverse outcomes and ensuring appropriate candidate selection.

2. **Absolute Contraindications Are Non-Negotiable**: Active psychosis, uncontrolled hypertension, and known ketamine allergy represent firm exclusions. Do not rationalize exceptions.

3. **Relative Contraindications Require Documentation**: When proceeding with relative contraindications, document the risk-benefit analysis, precautions taken, and informed consent discussion.

4. **Validate Treatment Resistance**: Confirm that "treatment-resistant depression" meets operational criteria through medical record review, not patient report alone. Ensure adequate dosing, duration, and adherence of previous trials.

5. **Standardize Your Process**: Develop intake protocols, screening batteries, and documentation templates. Consistency improves safety and supports defensible practice.

6. **Screen for Dissociation and Psychosis Risk**: These conditions require specialized assessment. The DES and PRIME Screen are brief but important additions to standard depression/anxiety measures.

7. **Medical Clearance Is Medical Necessity**: Document baseline health status and address cardiovascular, hepatic, and other medical factors systematically. Specialist consultation demonstrates appropriate caution.

8. **Plan for the Worst**: Even well-screened patients can have unexpected responses. Have emergency protocols, reversal agents, and escalation pathways ready before beginning treatment.
