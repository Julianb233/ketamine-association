# Clinical Documentation Standards for Ketamine Treatment

Comprehensive clinical documentation is the backbone of quality ketamine therapy. Proper documentation serves multiple critical functions: supporting continuity of care, demonstrating medical necessity, enabling outcome tracking, meeting regulatory requirements, and providing legal protection. This guide establishes documentation standards that every ketamine practice should implement.

## The Importance of Documentation

### Why Documentation Matters

| Purpose | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Patient safety | Communication among providers; continuity of care |
| Quality improvement | Track outcomes; identify areas for improvement |
| Legal protection | Defense in malpractice claims; demonstrate standard of care |
| Regulatory compliance | DEA, state medical board, HIPAA requirements |
| Billing/reimbursement | Support medical necessity; justify charges |
| Research/audit | Generate data for outcomes research; accreditation |

### Documentation Principles

**FACT**: Documentation should be:
- **F**actual: Objective observations, not opinions or judgments
- **A**ccurate: Precise, truthful, without exaggeration
- **C**omplete: All relevant information included
- **T**imely: Documented contemporaneously or as soon as possible

**Additional Principles**:
- Patient-centered: Focus on patient's presentation and response
- Legible: Readable by all who need access
- Standardized: Consistent format enables efficient review
- Signed and dated: Clear attribution and timing

## Initial Evaluation Documentation

### Comprehensive Psychiatric Evaluation

**Required Components**:

#### Identifying Information
```
Patient Name:
Date of Birth:
Medical Record Number:
Date of Evaluation:
Evaluating Provider:
Referral Source:
```

#### Chief Complaint
Document in patient's own words why they are seeking treatment.

**Example**:
"Patient reports: 'I've tried everything for my depression and nothing works. I heard ketamine might help.'"

#### History of Present Illness (HPI)

**Required Elements**:

| Element | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|
| Current symptoms | Specific depressive/anxiety symptoms |
| Onset | When current episode began |
| Duration | How long symptoms have been present |
| Severity | Impact on functioning; severity ratings |
| Course | Worsening, stable, fluctuating |
| Precipitants | Triggers or contributing factors |
| Associated symptoms | Sleep, appetite, concentration, energy |
| Suicidal ideation | Current and recent suicidal thoughts/behaviors |

**Example**:
"45-year-old female presenting with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Current depressive episode began approximately 18 months ago following job loss. Symptoms have been persistent and gradually worsening despite multiple treatment trials. Current symptoms include depressed mood most of the day nearly every day, anhedonia (previously enjoyed gardening and reading), initial insomnia with early morning awakening, decreased appetite with 15-pound weight loss over 6 months, fatigue, difficulty concentrating affecting job performance, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, and passive suicidal ideation ('sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me') without current plan or intent. Patient denies active suicidal intent, access to means, or prior suicide attempts. PHQ-9 score today: 22 (severe). GAD-7 score: 14 (moderate anxiety)."

#### Psychiatric History

**Required Elements**:

| Element | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|
| Previous episodes | Number, timing, duration, severity |
| Hospitalizations | Dates, reasons, duration, facilities |
| Suicide attempts | Details, means, medical treatment |
| Prior diagnoses | Including revisions |
| Previous treatments | Medications, therapy, other |

**Medication History Documentation**:

Create a comprehensive table of past psychiatric medications:

| Medication | Max Dose | Duration | Response | Reason Stopped |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Sertraline | 200 mg | 8 weeks | Minimal | Ineffective |
| Bupropion | 450 mg | 12 weeks | Partial | Added to next |
| Venlafaxine | 225 mg | 10 weeks | Minimal | Ineffective |
| Lithium augmentation | 900 mg | 6 weeks | None | Ineffective |

**Documentation of Treatment Resistance**:

Specifically document criteria for treatment-resistant depression:
- Number of adequate antidepressant trials (≥2 required)
- Documentation of adequate dose and duration for each
- Assessment of adherence
- Nature of response (none, partial, initial then loss)

**Example**:
"Treatment history documents failure of five adequate antidepressant trials from different classes over the past 18 months: sertraline (SSRI), venlafaxine (SNRI), bupropion (NDRI), mirtazapine (NaSSA), and lithium augmentation. All trials were at adequate doses for adequate duration (minimum 6 weeks at therapeutic dose). Patient reports good adherence, confirmed by pharmacy records. This meets criteria for treatment-resistant depression (Stage II by Thase-Rush staging)."

#### Medical History

**Required Documentation**:
- Chronic medical conditions
- Relevant acute conditions
- Surgical history
- Allergies (drug, environmental, food)
- Current medications (complete list)
- Review of systems

## Clinical Takeaways

1. **Document Thoroughly at Intake**: Comprehensive initial evaluation documentation establishes medical necessity, demonstrates appropriate patient selection, and provides baseline for outcome tracking.

2. **Standardize Treatment Documentation**: Use templates and checklists to ensure every treatment session is documented consistently and completely.

3. **Track Outcomes Systematically**: Use validated instruments at every visit. This data demonstrates efficacy, guides clinical decisions, and supports quality improvement.

4. **Support Billing with Documentation**: Medical necessity, time documentation, and appropriate coding all depend on thorough clinical documentation.

5. **Meet Controlled Substance Requirements**: DEA requirements for controlled substance documentation are specific and non-negotiable. Maintain meticulous inventory and administration logs.

6. **Audit Regularly**: Regular documentation audits identify deficiencies before they become problems. Create a culture of documentation excellence.

7. **Retain Records Appropriately**: Know your state's retention requirements and maintain secure, compliant record storage.

8. **Document in Real Time**: Contemporaneous documentation is more accurate and more defensible than retrospective documentation. Document during or immediately after each encounter.

---

*Excellent documentation is a hallmark of quality clinical care. While documentation requirements may seem burdensome, they ultimately serve patients through enhanced safety, continuity, and accountability. Invest in documentation systems and training to make thorough documentation efficient and routine.*
