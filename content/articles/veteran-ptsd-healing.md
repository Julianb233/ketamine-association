# A Veteran's Path to Healing: How Ketamine Helped When Nothing Else Could

*Note: This story is a composite narrative based on real veteran experiences. Names, units, and identifying details have been changed to protect privacy, but the journey reflects the authentic struggles and triumphs of service members who have found hope through ketamine therapy.*

---

Marcus still remembers the exact sound. Not the explosion itself—that part blurs in memory—but the silence that followed. Three seconds, maybe four, when the dust hung in the air and the world held its breath. Then the screaming started.

That was fifteen years ago. In many ways, Marcus never left that road in Iraq.

"People think trauma is remembering something terrible," he says now, hands wrapped around a coffee mug in a way that keeps them from shaking. "But for me, it was more like the terrible thing never stopped happening. I brought it home with me, and it played on repeat every night, sometimes every hour."

## Coming Home to a Different War

Marcus served three deployments over eight years. He was good at his job—convoy security, high-stress work that required constant vigilance. He earned commendations. He made rank. He told himself he was handling it.

"There's a culture in the military, especially in combat units, about being tough," he explains. "You see things, you do things, and you keep moving. Admitting something was wrong felt like weakness. So I didn't."

The problems started within months of his final deployment. Sleep became impossible—every noise jerked him awake, heart pounding, reaching for a weapon that wasn't there. Crowds felt dangerous; he'd position himself with his back to walls, scanning for threats at the grocery store. The hypervigilance that had kept him alive overseas was destroying him at home.

His marriage ended first. Then friendships. Then jobs, one after another, lost to absences when he couldn't force himself to leave the house or outbursts he couldn't control.

"I was angry all the time," Marcus admits. "Not at anything specific. Just... angry. At the world for being dangerous, at people for not understanding, at myself for not being able to fix it. Anger was easier than feeling the other stuff."

## The VA Years

Marcus eventually found his way to the VA, pushed there by a buddy who recognized the signs. The diagnosis came quickly: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, severe. The treatment came more slowly.

"I did everything they offered," Marcus recounts. "Exposure therapy, where you talk about the trauma over and over until it's supposed to lose its power. EMDR, with the eye movements. Group therapy with other vets. Medication after medication—antidepressants, sleep aids, stuff for anxiety."

Some things helped partially. The prazosin reduced his nightmares from every night to most nights. Group therapy gave him people who understood without needing explanations. Exposure therapy was brutal but eventually took some of the sharpest edges off certain memories.

But the core of the problem remained. Years into treatment, Marcus still couldn't sleep through the night, still couldn't relax in public, still felt the war living inside him every day.

"The VA providers were good people doing their best," he says firmly. "This isn't about blaming anyone. It's about the fact that for some of us, the standard treatments aren't enough. My brain had been changed by what it experienced, and pills and talk weren't changing it back."

## Hitting the Wall

Six years into civilian life, Marcus stopped caring whether he made it to year seven. He wasn't actively planning suicide—"I'm too stubborn for that," he says with a hint of dark humor—but he'd stopped taking care of himself. Stopped eating regularly, stopped leaving his apartment, stopped seeing the point.

"I was tired," he says simply. "Tired of fighting a war that no one else could see. Tired of trying treatments that didn't work. Tired of being told to have hope when hope felt like a lie."

His VA psychiatrist, Dr. Chen, noticed the decline. During one appointment, she sat quietly for a long moment, then said something that cut through Marcus's fog:

"Marcus, what we've been doing isn't working. I think you know that. I want to talk to you about something different."

She explained ketamine therapy—how it worked differently from other treatments, how it was showing promise for treatment-resistant PTSD, how some veterans were finding relief when nothing else had helped. She was honest about limitations: it wasn't covered by VA at the time, it required private payment, it wasn't a cure. But it was something they hadn't tried.

"She gave me research to read," Marcus recalls. "I'm not a big reader, but I read every word. Not because I believed it would work—I'd stopped believing anything would work. But because she believed in me enough to keep looking for options."

## A Different Approach

The ketamine clinic Marcus chose was run by a physician who was also a veteran—something that mattered to him. The intake process was thorough: medical history, trauma history, current symptoms, medications, support system.

"They asked about my military service with respect, not morbid curiosity," Marcus notes. "They'd worked with veterans before. They understood that military trauma isn't just about one bad day—it's about years of experiences that compound."

The treatment plan called for six initial infusions over three weeks, followed by evaluation for maintenance. Marcus's wife—his second wife, a woman who had known him only as the wounded version—drove him to every appointment.

"She didn't know what to expect any more than I did," he says. "But she was there. That mattered more than I can explain."

## The First Session

Marcus's first ketamine experience began unremarkably. The IV, the vitals check, the adjustment of the recliner. Then the medication started flowing, and the unremarkable became something else entirely.

"I didn't hallucinate or see visions or anything like that," he describes carefully. "It was more like... the world shifted. Everything felt farther away—the room, my body, the constant alertness that I'd lived with for years. For the first time I could remember, I wasn't on guard."

In that strange, distant state, Marcus found himself thinking about the ambush—not reliving it exactly, but observing it from somewhere outside his usual terror.

"I could see the memory without being in the memory. Does that make sense? I wasn't there with the dust and the blood and the screaming. I was watching it, almost like it was someone else's story."

From that vantage point, something unexpected emerged: grief. Not fear, not anger—the emotions Marcus knew well—but pure sadness for the friends lost that day, for the young man he had been, for all the years spent trapped in that moment.

"I cried," Marcus says quietly. "First time in years. The whole infusion, tears rolling down my face while I floated somewhere outside myself. The nurse held my hand. She didn't say anything. Just held it."

When the dissociation cleared and Marcus returned to normal awareness, he felt different. Not fixed—he knew himself well enough to not expect miracles—but different. Lighter, somehow. As if he'd set down something he'd been carrying without realizing it.

## The Road Through

The following infusions built on that first experience. Not every session brought emotional breakthroughs; some were primarily physical experiences, the dissociation doing its neurological work without dramatic psychological content. But gradually, session by session, Marcus began to change.

"The nightmares decreased first," he recalls. "Not gone, but less frequent, less intense. I started sleeping more than four hours at a time. My wife said I stopped flinching at every sound."

The hypervigilance—that exhausting constant alertness—began to soften. Marcus could go to a restaurant without positioning himself facing the door. He could ride in a car without checking every potential threat. He was still aware, still alert, but no longer locked in survival mode every moment.

"It was like my brain finally got the message that the war was over," he explains. "That I wasn't in danger anymore. After years of knowing that intellectually but not believing it in my body, my body started to believe it."

The anger diminished too, replaced by emotions Marcus had buried for years. He grieved—really grieved—for friends killed in combat, processing losses he'd sealed away because combat didn't allow time for grief. He reconnected with memories of camaraderie, of purpose, of the parts of his service that weren't traumatic.

"I'd forgotten that not all of it was terrible," Marcus admits. "I'd reduced years of experience to just the worst moments. Ketamine helped me remember the whole picture."

## Integration and Beyond

Marcus understood that ketamine alone wasn't the complete answer. The clinic connected him with a therapist experienced in trauma work, and he committed to integration sessions after each infusion.

"The ketamine cracked things open," he explains. "But I needed help making sense of what came out. The therapy helped me process the emotions, develop new ways of thinking about what happened, build skills for managing symptoms."

He also re-engaged with the VA, this time approaching treatment from a stronger baseline. The exposure therapy that had felt overwhelming before became manageable. Medications that had seemed to do nothing showed more effect when his nervous system wasn't in constant crisis.

"Everything worked better when I wasn't drowning," Marcus says. "The ketamine got my head above water. Then all the other stuff could actually reach me."

After the initial series, Marcus moved to maintenance treatments—monthly at first, then every six to eight weeks as his stability increased. Two years later, he comes in roughly every two months, adjusting based on symptoms and stress levels.

"It's not cheap," he acknowledges. "It's a real financial commitment. But my family, my health, my ability to have a life—that's worth it. I'd spent years spending money on things trying to feel better that didn't work. This actually works."

## Life Reclaimed

Today, Marcus works part-time at a veteran service organization, helping other former service members navigate the transition home. He finds purpose in using his experience to help others, in being honest about his struggles and his path through them.

"When a vet comes in and I can see that thousand-yard stare, I know where they are," he says. "I've been there. And I can tell them, truthfully, that there's a way through. Not because I read about it in a book, but because I walked it."

His marriage is stronger than it's ever been. He's present with his wife in ways he couldn't be before, able to connect emotionally rather than operating from behind a wall of hypervigilance and numbness.

"She says she feels like she finally met me," Marcus reflects. "The real me, not the damaged version. That's not quite right—I'm still the same person, still shaped by everything that happened. But I'm not controlled by it anymore."

He's even reconnected with some of his military buddies, relationships he'd let lapse because being around other vets triggered too many memories. Now those connections are sources of support rather than pain.

"We talk about the hard stuff now," he says. "Really talk about it. And we talk about what comes after too—how we're building lives, raising families, finding meaning. I couldn't do that before. I couldn't see past the trauma to anything else."

## Words for Fellow Veterans

When Marcus talks to other veterans considering ketamine therapy, he's direct and honest.

"First, do your research. Not every clinic is the same, and you want people who understand military trauma specifically. Second, go into it with realistic expectations. It's not magic. It's a tool, maybe the best tool I found, but still just a tool. You have to use it alongside other things."

He pauses, gathering his thoughts.

"Third, if traditional treatments haven't worked for you—if you've done the VA protocol and you're still suffering—don't assume that means nothing will work. I spent years thinking I was broken beyond repair. I was wrong. My brain just needed something different than what we'd tried."

His voice strengthens.

"And fourth, there's no weakness in getting help. Zero. You want to talk about strength? Strength is admitting you're hurting and doing something about it. Strength is sitting in that clinic chair for the first time when you don't know what will happen. Strength is building a life after you thought you'd lost that chance."

Marcus looks out the window, where the afternoon light is softening.

"I lost friends over there. Good people who didn't come home. I've thought a lot about what I owe them, what it means to honor their memory. And I think the answer is this: living. Really living, not just surviving. Being present for my family, helping my fellow veterans, building something worthwhile with the years I was given."

He turns back, eyes clear.

"Ketamine helped me do that. After everything else failed, it helped me find my way back to life. If my story helps even one other veteran find their way too, then every hard moment was worth it."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can ketamine help with military PTSD?

Research shows promising results for ketamine in treating PTSD, including military-related trauma. Many veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD—those who haven't responded adequately to traditional therapies like exposure therapy, EMDR, or medications—have found significant relief through ketamine therapy. The treatment appears to help reduce hypervigilance, nightmares, and the intrusive memories characteristic of combat-related PTSD.

### Is ketamine covered by the VA?

Currently, ketamine therapy for PTSD is generally not covered by the VA as a standard treatment, though some VA facilities are conducting research studies. Most veterans access ketamine therapy through private clinics and pay out-of-pocket. It's worth checking with your VA provider about any ongoing research programs or coverage changes, as this landscape is evolving.

### How is ketamine different from other PTSD treatments?

Unlike exposure therapy or traditional medications that work gradually over weeks or months, ketamine can produce rapid effects within hours to days. It works through a different brain system (glutamate rather than serotonin), which may explain why it helps some veterans who haven't responded to other treatments. Ketamine also appears to create a "window of neuroplasticity" that can enhance the effectiveness of trauma-focused therapy.

### How many ketamine treatments do veterans typically need?

Most protocols begin with an initial series of 6 treatments over 2-3 weeks, followed by maintenance treatments as needed. Veterans often continue with periodic "booster" sessions—ranging from monthly to every few months—to maintain benefits. The frequency varies based on individual response and is adjusted over time.
