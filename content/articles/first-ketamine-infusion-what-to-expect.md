## Before Your Appointment: Getting Ready

Preparation for ketamine therapy actually begins well before you arrive at the clinic. Taking the right steps beforehand can significantly improve your experience and outcomes.

> **Not sure if ketamine is right for you?** Read our guide: [Is Ketamine Therapy Right for You? A Decision-Making Guide](/blog/is-ketamine-right-for-you)

### The Week Before

**Finalize Logistics**

- **Confirm your appointment time and location**: Know exactly where you're going and plan for potential traffic or parking challenges
- **Arrange transportation**: You absolutely cannot drive after your infusion. Have a friend, family member, or rideshare planned for pickup
- **Clear your schedule**: Plan for a quiet day; don't schedule important meetings or decisions for afterwards
- **Discuss work arrangements**: Most people need the rest of the treatment day off

**Medical Preparation**

Your provider will have given you specific instructions, which may include:

- **Medication adjustments**: Certain medications may need to be paused or modified
- **Benzodiazepines**: Often held for 24-48 hours before treatment
- **Lamotrigine**: Some providers adjust dosing
- **Other medications**: Follow your provider's specific guidance

**Never stop medications without explicit direction from your healthcare provider.** If you're unsure, call and ask.

**Physical Preparation**

- **Avoid alcohol**: For at least 24-48 hours before treatment
- **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water in the days leading up
- **Get good sleep**: Being well-rested can improve your experience
- **Avoid recreational substances**: Complete abstinence leading up to treatment

### The Day Before

**Finalize Your Mindset**

- Spend some time thinking about your intentions for treatment
- Consider writing down what you hope to gain or explore
- Practice any relaxation or meditation techniques you know

- Select comfortable clothes for tomorrow (layers are helpful—temperatures can feel variable)
- Choose items to bring: headphones, eye mask, meaningful objects, playlist
- Confirm your ride is arranged
- Review any instructions from your provider

### The Morning Of

**Physical Needs**

- **Fasting requirements**: Most clinics ask you to fast for 4-6 hours before treatment
- **Morning medications**: Take only as specifically directed by your provider
- **Hydration**: Drink water until your fasting period begins (usually okay closer to appointment time)
- **Light eating**: If eating is allowed, keep it light

**Mental Preparation**

- Take time for quiet reflection or meditation
- Review your intentions
- Practice self-compassion—this is a brave step you're taking
- Know that nervousness is normal and doesn't predict a difficult experience

**What to Wear**

- Loose, comfortable clothing without restrictive waistbands
- Layers (clinic temperatures vary, and your perception may shift)
- Comfortable shoes you can easily remove
- Avoid complicated jewelry or accessories

**What to Bring**

- **ID and insurance cards** (if applicable)
- **Payment method** for your portion
- **Headphones** (often recommended—bring your own for comfort)
- **Eye mask** (many clinics provide these, but bring your own if preferred)
- **Comfort items**: A meaningful object, photo, or memento
- **Water bottle** for afterward
- **Snacks** for after (some people are hungry; others aren't)
- **Journal** if you want to write reflections afterward

## Arriving at the Clinic

### Check-In Process

When you arrive, you'll go through a standard intake process:

- **Paperwork**: Insurance verification, consent forms, intake questionnaires
- **Vitals**: Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature
- **Final screening**: The provider will confirm you're appropriate for treatment that day
- **Questions answered**: Take this opportunity to ask anything lingering

### Meeting Your Care Team

You'll meet the professionals who will support you:

- **The administering provider**: Often an MD, NP, or certified nurse anesthetist
- **Support staff**: Who will monitor you throughout
- **Possibly a psychotherapist**: Some clinics incorporate therapy

Use this time to:
- Share any last-minute concerns
- Discuss your intentions if you feel comfortable
- Ask about what to expect during the experience
- Establish communication signals (if you need something during the infusion)

### The Treatment Room

Treatment rooms vary but typically include:

- **A comfortable recliner or bed**: Where you'll spend the infusion
- **Monitoring equipment**: For blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen
- **Dim, calming lighting**: Bright lights are usually minimized
- **Calming decor**: Many clinics prioritize a peaceful atmosphere
- **Privacy**: The session is generally just you and the monitoring staff

You'll get settled in your chair or bed and get comfortable. This is when to:
- Use the restroom one final time
- Put on your headphones and eye mask
- Get blankets adjusted
- Find your comfortable position

## During the Infusion

### Starting the IV

For IV ketamine, a small intravenous catheter will be placed:

- **Usually in your arm or hand**
- **Brief pinch** during insertion
- **Taped securely** so you don't need to worry about it
- **Connected to the infusion pump** that controls the medication delivery

The IV placement is typically the only physical discomfort involved.

### The Onset of Effects

The infusion typically runs for 40-60 minutes. Effects usually begin within a few minutes:

**Minutes 1-5:**
- You may notice a slight floating or lightness
- Colors may seem slightly different
- A sense of calm often begins

**Minutes 5-15:**
- Effects intensify gradually
- Dissociative effects become more apparent
- You may feel increasingly detached from your body

**Minutes 15-40:**
- Full effect level typically reached
- Most intense part of the experience
- Time perception may become distorted

**Minutes 40-60 (infusion ending):**
- Effects begin to gradually decrease
- Reconnection with environment begins
- Often a period of peaceful reflection

### What the Experience May Feel Like

Ketamine affects everyone differently, and even your own experiences may vary session to session. Common experiences include:

**Physical Sensations:**
- Floating or weightlessness
- Heaviness in limbs
- Tingling or warmth
- Feeling detached from your body

**Perceptual Changes:**
- Visual effects: colors may seem more vivid, patterns may appear
- Sound may seem different or distant
- Time may seem to slow down, speed up, or become meaningless
- Space may feel expanded or compressed

**Mental/Emotional Experiences:**
- A sense of peace or calm
- Emotional release (tears, laughter)
- Profound insights or new perspectives
- Feeling connected to something larger than yourself
- Reviewing memories or life experiences
- Experiencing dreamlike imagery

**What You'll Remain Aware Of:**
- You'll likely hear things around you (though they may seem distant)
- You can typically communicate if needed (though you may not want to)
- You'll know where you are and that you're having a treatment
- You're not unconscious—it's more like a deeply altered state

### What to Do During the Experience

**Helpful Approaches:**

- **Let go**: Try not to control or direct the experience; allow it to unfold
- **Stay curious**: Approach whatever arises with interest rather than judgment
- **Breathe**: If things feel intense, return attention to your breath
- **Remember it's temporary**: The intense effects will pass within the hour
- **Trust the process**: Difficult moments often lead to valuable insights

**If Things Feel Difficult:**

- Remember you are safe and monitored
- Breathe slowly and deeply
- You can communicate with staff if needed (raising a hand is often easiest)
- Remind yourself that the effects will subside
- Intense experiences often carry the most therapeutic value

**Common Helpful Thoughts:**

- "This is temporary"
- "I am safe"
- "I can allow this to be whatever it is"
- "There may be something here for me to learn"

### Staff Monitoring

Throughout your infusion, staff will:

- Check your vital signs periodically
- Ensure you're comfortable
- Be available if you need anything
- Generally maintain a quiet, supportive presence

Most clinics try to minimize disturbance during the experience while ensuring your safety.

## After the Infusion

### The Recovery Period

When the infusion ends, effects don't stop immediately:

**First 15-30 Minutes:**
- Effects gradually diminish but you'll still feel altered
- Staff will monitor your recovery
- Stay seated or lying down
- Don't try to stand yet

**30-60 Minutes Post-Infusion:**
- Most acute effects have passed
- You may feel drowsy, peaceful, or slightly disoriented
- Staff will check that you're ready for discharge
- Have a snack or water if desired

### Assessment Before Discharge

Before you leave, staff will ensure:

- Vital signs are stable
- You can walk safely
- You're oriented and communicating clearly
- Your ride has arrived
- You have follow-up instructions

You'll typically be at the clinic for 1.5-2 hours total.

### Getting Home

Once discharged:

- **Go directly home** or somewhere restful
- **Don't make stops** that require decision-making
- **Have your ride stay with you** for a while if possible
- **Take it easy** for the rest of the day

## The Rest of Day One

### What to Expect That Evening

The rest of your treatment day is typically characterized by:

- **Continued mellowness**: You may feel dreamy or floaty
- **Possible fatigue**: Some people need extra sleep
- **Appetite changes**: You may or may not be hungry
- **Emotional sensitivity**: Feelings may be more accessible
- **Cognitive changes**: Concentration may be reduced

### Recommended Activities

**Do:**
- Rest
- Watch something light and pleasant
- Listen to gentle music
- Spend quiet time with supportive people
- Eat nourishing food when hungry
- Stay hydrated
- Reflect or journal if you feel drawn to

**Don't:**
- Drive
- Make important decisions
- Work
- Engage in difficult conversations
- Use alcohol or other substances
- Exercise intensely
- Take on stressful tasks

## The Days Following Treatment

### Day 2 and Beyond

Most people feel essentially normal by the day after treatment:

- Cognitive function typically returns to baseline
- Physical symptoms resolve
- Some residual emotional processing may continue
- Antidepressant effects may be emerging

### Tracking Your Response

Pay attention to:

- Your mood and energy levels
- Sleep quality
- Anxiety levels
- Interest in activities
- Suicidal thoughts (if applicable)
- Overall sense of wellbeing

Many clinics provide rating scales to track these systematically. Even keeping a simple daily journal can help you and your provider understand your response.

### The Emergence of Benefits

Antidepressant effects, if they occur, typically unfold like this:

- **Hours 1-24**: Some people notice early shifts
- **24-72 hours**: Peak response for many patients
- **Days 3-7**: Effects plateau or continue building
- **Week 2+**: Variable—some maintain gains, others may see return of symptoms

Remember that response varies widely. Some people feel dramatically better quickly; others have more subtle or gradual improvement.

### Integration

The days after treatment represent what some call a "neuroplasticity window"—a period when the brain may be especially receptive to positive change. Consider:

- **Therapy**: If you have a therapist, schedule sessions for this window
- **Journaling**: Write about insights, memories, or perspectives that arose
- **Healthy practices**: Exercise, social connection, time in nature
- **Intention-setting**: Reinforce positive goals and behaviors
- **Self-compassion**: Be patient with yourself as you process

## Preparing for Subsequent Treatments

If ketamine is helping you, you'll likely have additional infusions. Each session builds on the last.

### What Changes Over Time

- You'll know what to expect, reducing anxiety
- You may be able to go deeper into the experience
- Themes or insights may develop across sessions
- Response patterns become clearer

### Maintaining Momentum

Between treatments:
- Continue tracking your response
- Engage in integration activities
- Communicate with your treatment team
- Practice healthy habits that support mental health

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does a ketamine infusion take?

The infusion itself typically lasts 40-60 minutes for IV ketamine. Including check-in, preparation, the infusion, and recovery monitoring, plan to be at the clinic for approximately 2-2.5 hours total. You'll need the rest of the day to recover at home.

### Will I be unconscious during ketamine treatment?

No, you won't be unconscious. Ketamine produces a dissociative state where you may feel detached from your body and surroundings, but you'll remain aware that you're having a treatment. You can typically communicate with staff if needed, though you may not want to talk during the experience.

### Can I drive myself home after ketamine?

No, you absolutely cannot drive after a ketamine infusion. The effects impair your judgment, coordination, and reaction time for several hours after treatment. You must arrange for someone else to drive you home—a friend, family member, or rideshare service.

### What if I have a bad experience during the infusion?

Difficult experiences during ketamine are not uncommon and are usually manageable. Staff are trained to support you through challenging moments. You can raise your hand to signal for help, and the dose can be adjusted if needed. Remember that the effects are temporary and will subside. Many patients find that challenging experiences ultimately lead to therapeutic insights.

### How many ketamine infusions will I need?

Most protocols involve an initial series of 6 infusions over 2-3 weeks (the "induction phase"). After this, maintenance treatments are typically needed to sustain benefits, ranging from weekly to monthly depending on your response. Your provider will create a personalized plan based on how you respond.

### What should I eat before ketamine treatment?

Most clinics require you to fast for 4-6 hours before treatment to reduce nausea risk. You can usually drink clear liquids (water) until a couple hours before. Follow your specific clinic's instructions. After treatment, eat light, easily digestible foods when you feel ready.
