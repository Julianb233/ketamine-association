# Building a Ketamine Practice: A Complete Guide for Practitioners

Establishing a ketamine therapy practice requires careful planning across clinical, regulatory, and business dimensions. Unlike traditional psychiatric practices, ketamine clinics operate at the intersection of procedural medicine and mental health care, demanding unique infrastructure, staffing, and operational considerations. This comprehensive guide provides practitioners with a roadmap for building a compliant, sustainable, and clinically excellent ketamine practice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to start a ketamine clinic?

Startup costs vary widely based on your model and location. A basic single-provider practice may require $50,000-100,000 for equipment, buildout, and initial operating expenses. A larger multi-room clinic could require $200,000-500,000 or more. Key expenses include treatment equipment, monitoring devices, facility buildout, initial staffing, insurance, and licensing.

### What licenses and certifications do I need to open a ketamine clinic?

Requirements vary by state but typically include: valid medical/prescriber license, DEA registration (ketamine is Schedule III), business license, potentially facility licensure or sedation permits depending on your state, HIPAA compliance, and professional liability insurance that covers ketamine administration. Consult with a healthcare attorney in your state for specific requirements.

### Is a ketamine clinic profitable?

Ketamine practices can be financially viable when well-managed. With typical self-pay pricing of $400-800 per infusion and treatment capacity of 25-50 patients per week, monthly revenue can range from $40,000-160,000 or more. Profitability depends on controlling expenses (primarily staffing, rent, and supplies) while maintaining adequate patient volume. Most established practices report healthy margins once patient volume reaches sustainable levels.

### Should I offer IV ketamine or Spravato (esketamine)?

Many practices offer both. IV racemic ketamine offers more dosing flexibility and may be more effective for some patients, but is typically self-pay. Spravato (esketamine) is FDA-approved and more likely to be covered by insurance, but requires REMS program enrollment and specific protocols. Offering both allows you to serve different patient populations and insurance situations.
