# From Darkness to Light: One Patient's Journey Through Treatment-Resistant Depression

*Note: This story is a composite narrative based on real patient experiences. Names and identifying details have been changed to protect privacy, but the emotional journey reflects the authentic experiences of many who have found hope through ketamine therapy.*

Sarah doesn't remember exactly when the darkness settled in. Looking back, she thinks it might have started during her sophomore year of college—a gradual dimming that she first attributed to stress, then to the gray winters, then to nothing she could name at all.

"It wasn't like I woke up one day and couldn't function," she recalls. "It was more like someone slowly turning down a dimmer switch over years. By the time I realized something was seriously wrong, I couldn't remember what normal felt like."

## The Long Search for Help

By her late twenties, Sarah had tried nearly everything. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Martinez, walked her through the standard progression: SSRIs first, then SNRIs, then tricyclics. Each medication brought its own side effects—weight gain, sexual dysfunction, emotional numbness—but none brought lasting relief.

"I became an expert in the language of medication trials," Sarah says with a tired smile. "I knew about therapeutic doses and augmentation strategies and washout periods. I could discuss neurotransmitter theory at dinner parties, not that I went to many."

The official diagnosis was treatment-resistant depression—a clinical term that felt to Sarah like a judgment. "I remember thinking, even my brain can't get it right. It's resistant, like I'm somehow fighting against getting better."

She tried everything else too. Cognitive behavioral therapy helped with some negative thought patterns but couldn't touch the biological weight that pressed down on her every morning. Exercise was supposed to help, but on most days, getting from bed to the shower felt like running a marathon. She tried meditation apps, light therapy, supplements, acupuncture—a desperate catalog of attempts that grew each year.

"At some point, I stopped telling people about new things I was trying," Sarah admits. "The hope in their eyes when I'd mention something, and then having to see it fade when that thing didn't work either—it was too hard. On them and on me."

## Hitting Bottom

The lowest point came on an unremarkable Tuesday in March. Sarah had called in sick to work—something she was doing more frequently—and found herself standing in her kitchen, unable to remember why she'd walked there. The apartment was quiet. The refrigerator hummed. And she realized, with a clarity that felt almost peaceful, that she couldn't imagine feeling any other way.

"I wasn't actively planning to hurt myself," she says carefully. "But I wasn't planning not to, either. I had stopped caring about the future because I couldn't see one. That's a terrifying place to be, but at the time, it just felt like truth."

She called Dr. Martinez from the kitchen floor. Something in her voice must have alarmed him because he cleared his afternoon to see her that day. In his office, through tears she hadn't known she was still capable of crying, she told him she didn't know how much longer she could do this.

"He didn't minimize what I was feeling or rush to reassure me," Sarah remembers. "He just listened, really listened, and then he said he thought it was time to discuss some options we hadn't tried yet. That's when he first mentioned ketamine."

## A Different Kind of Hope

Sarah had heard of ketamine before—mostly in the context of club drugs and horse tranquilizers. She was skeptical.

"My first reaction was that it seemed desperate and weird," she laughs now. "Which, in retrospect, I absolutely was—desperate, I mean. And weird enough to have been standing in my kitchen wondering if I'd ever feel anything again."

Dr. Martinez explained the research: how ketamine worked through different brain pathways than traditional antidepressants, how it could sometimes help people who hadn't responded to other treatments, how the effects could be rapid in a way other medications weren't. He was careful not to oversell it—ketamine didn't work for everyone, and even when it did, the benefits required ongoing treatment to maintain.

"What I heard was 'there's something we haven't tried yet,'" Sarah says. "After years of diminishing options, that was everything."

The referral went to a ketamine clinic about an hour from Sarah's apartment. She researched the clinic extensively—reading reviews, checking credentials, learning about their protocols. The initial consultation involved extensive medical and psychological evaluation.

"They took it seriously, which made me take it seriously," Sarah recalls. "This wasn't some sketchy back-room operation. It was a medical procedure with doctors and nurses and informed consent forms that I actually read."

## The First Infusion

Sarah arrived for her first treatment on a Friday afternoon in April. The clinic space was calming but clinical—more comfortable than a hospital but clearly a medical environment. A nurse took her vitals and started an IV line, explaining each step. The psychiatrist on staff reviewed her history one more time and described what she might experience.

"They told me I might feel dissociated, like I was separate from my body or watching myself from outside. That I might have visual disturbances or feel like time was strange. They said to try to relax into whatever came, that fighting the experience usually made it harder."

The ketamine started as a slow drip. For the first few minutes, Sarah felt nothing. Then:

"It was like the room got farther away. Not scary—just different. My hands didn't quite feel like mine. The music they were playing seemed to come from very far away and also from inside my head at the same time."

Over the next forty minutes, Sarah experienced what she describes as a "reorganization of everything." Her thoughts, usually a relentless loop of self-criticism and despair, quieted. In their place came something she struggled to name.

"It wasn't happiness exactly. It was more like... possibility? Like I was seeing my life from above instead of from inside the darkness. I could see that I had been somewhere, but I wasn't necessarily stuck there. It sounds simple but after years of feeling trapped, that perspective shift was revolutionary."

By the time the infusion ended and the dissociation cleared, Sarah was crying again—but differently than in Dr. Martinez's office. These were tears of relief, of something cracking open.

## The Days After

The morning after her first infusion, Sarah woke up and noticed something strange: she wanted breakfast. She hadn't felt genuine hunger in months. More than that, she was curious what she would eat, interested in choosing something rather than mechanically fueling a body she felt disconnected from.

"I made eggs," she says. "Just scrambled eggs, nothing fancy. And I tasted them. Actually tasted them. I sat at my kitchen table eating eggs and crying because I could taste them."

This wasn't the end of her depression—ketamine isn't a cure. But over the following week, Sarah noticed other shifts. She laughed at something her coworker said. She called her mother without it feeling like an obligation. She walked to the grocery store and noticed that the trees had started blooming.

"I hadn't seen spring arrive in years," she realizes now. "I had been so inside myself that the entire world had become wallpaper. Ketamine didn't fix everything, but it helped me look up."

## Building a New Foundation

Sarah completed the initial series of six infusions over three weeks. Each session was different—some more intense than others, some accompanied by insights she discussed with her therapist, some primarily physical experiences without much psychological content.

"Not every infusion was a breakthrough," she notes. "Some were just... treatment. Medicine doing its thing while I lay there with my eyes closed. And that was okay too."

After the initial series, Sarah and her care team developed a maintenance plan. For the first few months, she came in every two to three weeks. As her stability increased, sessions stretched to monthly. Now, almost two years later, she comes in every six weeks or so, adjusting the frequency based on how she's feeling.

"I've learned to recognize when I'm starting to slip," Sarah explains. "There are subtle signs—my sleep gets worse, my interest in things dims, I start canceling plans. When I notice those, I schedule an infusion sooner. It's like having a tool I can actually use instead of just hoping the next pill will work."

The ketamine treatments became part of a broader approach. Sarah continued regular therapy, processing the insights that emerged during infusions and working on the patterns that contributed to her depression. She rebuilt exercise habits gradually, no longer from desperation but from emerging motivation. She repaired relationships that had suffered during her worst years.

"Ketamine gave me enough lift to do the other work," she summarizes. "It wasn't either/or. The medication created space for the therapy to work better. The therapy helped me integrate what was happening in the infusions. It all connected."

## Life Now

Today, Sarah's life looks different in ways large and small. She's been promoted at work—something she never pursued during her depressed years because she couldn't imagine wanting more responsibility. She's dating again, carefully, with a therapist-guided awareness of her patterns and needs. She's reconnected with friends she had pushed away and honest with them about her mental health journey.

"I tell people about the ketamine," she says. "Not everyone, not right away. But when it makes sense. The stigma around mental health treatment is real, but it's also slowly changing. If my story helps someone else find their way to treatment that works, the discomfort of disclosure is worth it."

She's realistic about what ketamine is and isn't. It requires ongoing treatment, regular appointments, significant cost. It's not a perfect solution—she still has hard days, still sometimes feels the old darkness trying to creep back. But she has tools now, and perspective, and something she hadn't had in years: a future she can imagine.

"Depression lies," Sarah says quietly. "It told me I would always feel that way, that nothing would help, that I was fundamentally broken. Ketamine helped me see the lie. Not through words or logic—I had tried to think my way out for years. But through actually experiencing something different. Feeling something different. Once I knew another way was possible, everything changed."

## Her Advice for Others

When Sarah talks to people considering ketamine therapy, she offers practical advice born from experience:

"Do your research. Find a reputable clinic with real medical oversight. Be patient—it might not work immediately or exactly how you expect. Keep doing the other things too—the therapy, the self-care, whatever supports you. And be honest with your providers about how you're really feeling."

But beyond the practical, she offers something harder to quantify: permission to hope.

"I know how it feels to be skeptical of yet another thing that's supposed to help. I know how it feels to be afraid of hoping because disappointment is so exhausting. But if you're where I was—if you've tried everything and nothing has worked—please consider this. Not because it's guaranteed to work, but because you deserve to try everything possible before giving up on yourself."

She pauses, looking out the window at the spring day outside.

"Two years ago, I couldn't see those trees. I couldn't see anything but darkness. Now I can see them, and I'm still here to see them, and both of those things feel like miracles. If ketamine can help someone else find their way to their own miracles, then sharing this story is the least I can do."
