# Treating Treatment-Resistant Depression: Advanced Protocol Considerations

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents one of the most challenging conditions in psychiatric practice and the primary indication for ketamine therapy. With approximately 30% of patients with major depressive disorder failing to achieve remission after multiple treatment trials, the need for effective interventions is substantial. This article examines advanced considerations in ketamine treatment for TRD, from proper diagnosis through long-term maintenance strategies.

## Defining Treatment-Resistant Depression

### Operational Definitions

The definition of TRD varies across studies and clinical settings, creating challenges for patient selection and outcome comparison:

| Definition Source | Criteria |
|------------------|----------|
| FDA (Spravato label) | Failure of ≥2 adequate antidepressant trials in current episode |
| Thase-Rush Staging | 5-stage model based on treatment failures |
| MGH Staging | Comprehensive model including augmentation |
| European Guidelines | ≥2 trials from different classes |

**Consensus Definition**: TRD is typically defined as failure to achieve adequate response (≥50% symptom reduction) or remission after two or more adequate antidepressant trials from different pharmacological classes.

### Staging Models for Treatment Resistance

**Thase-Rush Staging Model**:

| Stage | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| Stage I | Failure of ≥1 adequate trial of one major class |
| Stage II | Stage I + failure of adequate trial of different class |
| Stage III | Stage II + failure of adequate TCA trial |
| Stage IV | Stage III + failure of adequate MAOI trial |
| Stage V | Stage IV + failure of bilateral ECT course |

**Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH-S) Staging**:
- Points assigned for each failed trial
- Additional points for duration, dose optimization, augmentation failure
- Creates continuous resistance score

### Verifying Treatment Resistance

Before initiating ketamine therapy, practitioners must verify true treatment resistance:

**Documentation Checklist**:
- [ ] Confirm diagnosis of MDD (rule out bipolar, secondary causes)
- [ ] Verify ≥2 failed antidepressant trials
- [ ] Confirm adequate dose for each trial
- [ ] Confirm adequate duration (≥4-8 weeks at therapeutic dose)
- [ ] Assess adherence (pharmacy records, blood levels if available)
- [ ] Document augmentation attempts
- [ ] Consider comorbidity impact on resistance

**Common Pseudo-Resistance Factors**:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Inadequate dosing | Review maximum doses achieved |
| Short duration | Confirm ≥6-8 weeks at full dose |
| Non-adherence | Pharmacy fills, therapeutic drug monitoring |
| Misdiagnosis | Re-evaluate for bipolar, personality disorders |
| Active substance use | Drug screen, collateral history |
| Unaddressed comorbidity | Medical and psychiatric review |
| Psychosocial factors | Ongoing trauma, stressors |

## Initial Evaluation for Ketamine Therapy

### Comprehensive Assessment Components

**Psychiatric Evaluation**:

1. **Diagnostic Confirmation**
   - Structured diagnostic interview (SCID or MINI)
   - Rule out bipolar disorder (critical for safety)
   - Assess for psychotic features
   - Identify comorbid conditions

2. **Treatment History**
   - Detailed medication history with doses and durations
   - Response to each medication (partial vs. none)
   - Adverse effects and tolerability
   - ECT, TMS, psychotherapy trials
   - Family history of treatment response

3. **Current Symptom Assessment**
   - Depression severity (MADRS, HAM-D, PHQ-9)
   - Suicidal ideation (C-SSRS)
   - Anxiety symptoms (GAD-7)
   - Functional impairment
   - Quality of life measures

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Suicide risk stratification
   - Substance use history
   - Psychosis risk factors
   - Cardiovascular risk

**Medical Evaluation**:

| System | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Cardiovascular | BP, HR, ECG if risk factors |
| Hepatic | LFTs, hepatic function |
| Neurological | Rule out organic causes |
| Endocrine | Thyroid function, metabolic panel |
| Substance | Urine drug screen |

### Predictors of Ketamine Response

Research has identified several factors associated with ketamine response in TRD:

**Positive Predictors**:

| Factor | Evidence Level |
|--------|---------------|
| Family history of alcohol use disorder | Moderate |
| Higher BMI | Moderate |
| Anxious depression | Moderate |
| Shorter current episode duration | Moderate |
| Fewer prior failed trials | Moderate |
| Higher baseline BDNF | Emerging |
| Anterior cingulate activity on fMRI | Research |

**Negative Predictors**:

| Factor | Evidence Level |
|--------|---------------|
| Personality disorder comorbidity | Moderate |
| Chronic depression (>2 years) | Moderate |
| Higher degree of treatment resistance | Moderate |
| Active substance use | Clinical consensus |
| Lack of initial response to ketamine | Strong |

**Clinical Utility**: While no predictor has sufficient sensitivity/specificity for clinical decision-making alone, the absence of multiple negative predictors may support treatment candidacy.

## Ketamine Treatment Protocols for TRD

### Induction Phase Protocols

**Standard IV Protocol**:

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Dose | 0.5 mg/kg |
| Infusion rate | Over 40 minutes |
| Frequency | 2-3 treatments per week |
| Duration | 6 treatments over 2-3 weeks |
| Setting | Medical supervision, vitals monitoring |

**Esketamine (Spravato) Protocol** (FDA-approved):

| Phase | Dosing | Frequency |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Induction (weeks 1-4) | 56-84 mg | Twice weekly |
| Maintenance (weeks 5-8) | 56-84 mg | Weekly |
| Maintenance (week 9+) | 56-84 mg | Weekly or every 2 weeks |

### Dose Optimization Strategies

**Initial Response Assessment**:
After 2 treatments, assess for any response signal:
- No response: Consider dose increase
- Partial response: Continue current protocol
- Full response: Maintain and plan transition

**Dose Titration Protocol**:

| Scenario | Adjustment |
|----------|------------|
| No response after 0.5 mg/kg × 2 | Increase to 0.6-0.7 mg/kg |
| Minimal response after 0.6 mg/kg | Increase to 0.75 mg/kg |
| Partial response at 0.75 mg/kg | May trial up to 1.0 mg/kg |
| Excellent response with side effects | Consider reducing to 0.4 mg/kg |
| Rapid early response | Consider reducing frequency |

**Maximum Doses in Clinical Practice**:
- Standard: Up to 0.75 mg/kg IV
- Extended: Up to 1.0 mg/kg IV with experienced oversight
- Higher doses increase dissociation without clear efficacy benefit

### Treatment Frequency Optimization

**Intensive Phase**:
- 2-3 treatments per week for 2-3 weeks
- Typical: 6 treatments total
- May extend to 8-10 if showing gradual response

**Transition Phase**:
- Weekly treatments for 4 weeks
- Assess for sustained response
- Monitor for rapid relapse between treatments

**Maintenance Phase**:
- Every 2-4 weeks based on individual response
- Some patients maintain on monthly or less frequent treatment
- Return to more frequent dosing if relapse occurs

## Augmentation Strategies

### Concurrent Antidepressant Therapy

Ketamine should generally be used as augmentation to existing antidepressant therapy, not as monotherapy:

**Evidence-Based Combinations**:

| Medication Class | Considerations |
|-----------------|----------------|
| SSRIs/SNRIs | First-line, continue during ketamine |
| Lithium | May enhance ketamine response |
| Lamotrigine | Theoretical glutamatergic synergy |
| Bupropion | Commonly continued |
| Atypical antipsychotics | Continue if previously helpful |

**Medications to Avoid or Adjust**:

| Medication | Issue | Recommendation |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| Benzodiazepines | May blunt ketamine effect | Hold on treatment days |
| MAOIs | Theoretical risk | 2-week washout |
| Naltrexone | May reduce ketamine effect | Hold 72 hours prior |

### Psychotherapy Integration

**Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy Models**:

1. **Preparation-Integration Model**
   - Preparation session before ketamine
   - Ketamine administration (medical)
   - Integration session after ketamine
   - Focus on processing insights

2. **Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP)**
   - Therapy occurs during ketamine session
   - Therapist present during treatment
   - Lower doses may be used
   - Focus on material emerging during session

3. **Conventional Therapy Plus Ketamine**
   - Regular therapy continues independently
   - Ketamine administered medically
   - Enhanced learning may boost therapy efficacy
   - No direct integration of ketamine experiences

**Evidence**: While RCT evidence specifically for ketamine-psychotherapy combination is limited, clinical observations suggest enhanced psychotherapy outcomes during the neuroplasticity window following ketamine.

### Lifestyle and Behavioral Augmentation

**Evidence-Based Adjuncts**:

| Intervention | Evidence | Implementation |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| Exercise | Strong for depression | 150 min/week moderate activity |
| Sleep optimization | Strong | Sleep hygiene, CBT-I if needed |
| Light therapy | Moderate (seasonal) | 10,000 lux morning exposure |
| Social activation | Moderate | Behavioral activation techniques |
| Nutrition | Emerging | Mediterranean diet pattern |
| Mindfulness | Strong | MBCT, MBSR programs |

## Managing Non-Response

### Defining Non-Response

**Assessment Timeline**:
- After 2 treatments: May see early signal
- After 4 treatments: Should see partial response if will respond
- After 6 treatments: Final response assessment

**Non-Response Criteria**:
- <25% improvement in depression scores
- No clinical improvement reported by patient
- No functional improvement observed

### Troubleshooting Non-Response

**Protocol Adjustments**:

| Issue | Intervention |
|-------|--------------|
| Subtherapeutic dose | Titrate up to 0.75-1.0 mg/kg |
| Benzodiazepine interference | Hold BZDs on treatment days |
| Inadequate frequency | Increase to 3× weekly |
| Insufficient sessions | Extend to 8-10 treatments |
| Route issue | Consider switching IV ↔ IN |

**Re-Evaluation Considerations**:
- Confirm diagnosis (reassess for bipolarity)
- Address ongoing substance use
- Evaluate for untreated comorbidity
- Consider medical contributors
- Assess psychosocial factors

### Alternative Approaches for Non-Responders

**After Ketamine Non-Response**:

| Option | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| ECT | Gold standard for TRD; may try before or after ketamine |
| TMS | Consider if not tried; less invasive than ECT |
| VNS | Surgical option for refractory cases |
| Deep TMS | Newer modality, emerging evidence |
| Psilocybin | Clinical trials; not yet FDA-approved |
| Esketamine if IV failed | Different pharmacokinetics; may help some |

## Long-Term Maintenance Approaches

### Determining Maintenance Need

**Factors Favoring Maintenance**:
- History of rapid relapse after ketamine discontinuation
- Chronic depressive course
- Poor response to oral antidepressants alone
- High functional stakes (occupation, family)
- Patient preference

**Factors Favoring Discontinuation**:
- First depressive episode
- Strong response to re-established oral therapy
- Patient preference
- Access/cost barriers
- Side effect concerns

### Maintenance Protocols

**Scheduled Maintenance**:

| Frequency | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| Weekly | High relapse risk, initial stabilization |
| Every 2 weeks | Moderate relapse risk |
| Every 3-4 weeks | Stable patients |
| Monthly or less | Well-stabilized patients |

**PRN/Response-Based Maintenance**:
- Patient monitors symptoms
- Returns when threshold reached (e.g., PHQ-9 >10)
- Requires reliable self-monitoring
- Works for patients with predictable relapse patterns

**Gradual Spacing Protocol**:
1. After successful induction: Weekly × 4 weeks
2. If stable: Every 2 weeks × 4-8 treatments
3. If stable: Every 3 weeks × 4 treatments
4. If stable: Monthly × 3-6 treatments
5. If stable: Attempt discontinuation with close monitoring

### Route Transition for Maintenance

Many clinics transition stable patients from IV to sublingual or intranasal for maintenance:

**IV to Sublingual Transition**:
- Establish response with IV induction
- Determine equivalent sublingual dose (typically 2-4× IV dose)
- Trial sublingual in supervised setting
- If effective, may transition to home administration with telemedicine oversight

**Considerations**:
- Bioavailability differences require dose adjustment
- Some patients respond to one route but not another
- Supervised sessions periodically to reassess
- Clear protocols for adherence monitoring

### Monitoring During Maintenance

**Regular Assessments**:

| Assessment | Frequency |
|------------|-----------|
| Depression scales (PHQ-9) | Each visit |
| Suicidality assessment (C-SSRS) | Each visit |
| Functional assessment | Monthly |
| Vital signs | Each treatment |
| Tolerability review | Each visit |
| Substance use screening | Periodically |
| Comprehensive psychiatric eval | Every 3-6 months |

**Relapse Indicators**:
- ≥2 point increase in PHQ-9 from stable baseline
- Return of suicidal ideation
- Functional decline
- Patient-reported worsening
- Sleep or appetite changes

### Discontinuation Strategies

**Planned Discontinuation**:
1. Gradual spacing of treatments
2. Close symptom monitoring
3. Ensure robust oral antidepressant regimen
4. Establish threshold for resumption
5. Clear patient education on relapse signs

**Managing Post-Discontinuation Relapse**:
- Rapid reinstatement usually effective
- May not need full induction course
- Return to previous effective maintenance schedule
- Consider if indefinite maintenance indicated

## Special Considerations in TRD

### Bipolar Depression

**Critical Distinctions**:
- Unipolar vs. bipolar depression often misdiagnosed
- Antidepressant response pattern may hint at bipolarity
- Family history of bipolar disorder is risk factor

**Ketamine in Bipolar Depression**:
- Emerging evidence supports efficacy
- MUST be combined with mood stabilizer
- Risk of inducing mania/hypomania
- More conservative monitoring

**Recommended Approach**:
- Lithium or valproate at therapeutic levels
- Lower starting ketamine doses
- Close monitoring for mood switches
- Patient education on mania symptoms

### Depression with Psychotic Features

**Generally Contraindicated**: Ketamine's pro-psychotomimetic effects create risk

**If Considered**:
- Only after psychosis fully resolved
- Antipsychotic coverage mandatory
- Very close monitoring
- Specialist oversight
- Low threshold for discontinuation

### Chronic Depression

**Characteristics**:
- Duration >2 years
- Often with personality disorder comorbidity
- Lower placebo response rates
- May need more intensive or prolonged treatment

**Modified Approach**:
- Realistic expectation setting
- Extended induction courses
- Integration with psychotherapy
- Longer maintenance commitment
- Focus on functional improvements alongside symptom reduction

## Documentation and Outcome Tracking

### Essential Documentation

**Initial Documentation**:
- Treatment resistance criteria met and documented
- Medical clearance completed
- Contraindication screening negative
- Informed consent for off-label use (if applicable)
- Baseline depression severity recorded
- Treatment plan with specific protocol

**Per-Treatment Documentation**:
- Pre-treatment assessment
- Exact dose and route
- Vital signs throughout
- Patient response/experience
- Any adverse events
- Post-treatment assessment
- Discharge status

**Longitudinal Documentation**:
- Treatment response tracking
- Cumulative side effects
- Functional outcomes
- Treatment plan modifications
- Relapse and response patterns

### Outcome Measures

**Primary Efficacy Measures**:

| Measure | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| MADRS | Research-quality assessment |
| HAM-D | Clinical trials |
| PHQ-9 | Routine clinical practice |
| QIDS-SR | Session-to-session tracking |

**Secondary Outcome Measures**:

| Domain | Instrument |
|--------|------------|
| Anxiety | GAD-7, HAM-A |
| Suicidality | C-SSRS, BSS |
| Functioning | SDS, WHODAS 2.0 |
| Quality of life | Q-LES-Q-SF |
| Cognition | Brief cognitive screening |

**Response Definitions**:
- **Response**: ≥50% reduction in depression score
- **Partial response**: 25-49% reduction
- **Remission**: PHQ-9 <5 or MADRS <10
- **Non-response**: <25% reduction

## Clinical Takeaways

1. **Verify True Treatment Resistance**: Before initiating ketamine, confirm that prior treatments were truly adequate in dose, duration, and adherence. Pseudo-resistance is common.

2. **Standardize Your Protocol**: Develop consistent protocols for induction and maintenance phases. While individualization is needed, a standard framework ensures consistency and supports outcome tracking.

3. **Use Ketamine as Augmentation**: Ketamine should augment, not replace, antidepressant therapy. Ensure patients have an optimized oral regimen alongside ketamine.

4. **Plan for the Long Term**: TRD is typically a chronic condition. Develop maintenance strategies from the outset rather than addressing durability reactively.

5. **Track Outcomes Systematically**: Use validated instruments to track depression severity, functioning, and quality of life. This data guides treatment decisions and supports clinical excellence.

6. **Address Non-Response Early**: If no response signal after 4 treatments, re-evaluate the diagnosis, address confounders, and consider protocol modifications before abandoning ketamine.

7. **Integrate Multimodal Treatment**: Ketamine creates a neuroplasticity window. Integrating psychotherapy, behavioral activation, and lifestyle modifications during this window may enhance outcomes.

8. **Document Thoroughly**: Comprehensive documentation of treatment resistance, medical clearance, informed consent, and outcomes protects patients and practitioners while building the evidence base.
