# Is Ketamine Therapy Right for You? A Decision-Making Guide

Deciding whether to pursue ketamine therapy is a deeply personal decision—one that deserves careful thought, honest self-assessment, and guidance from qualified healthcare providers. This isn't a treatment to pursue casually, but for the right candidates, it can be genuinely transformative.

This guide will help you think through whether ketamine might be appropriate for your situation. It's not a substitute for professional evaluation, but it can help you have a more informed conversation with your healthcare providers and make a decision you feel confident about.

## Who Typically Benefits from Ketamine?

Research and clinical experience have identified profiles of patients who tend to respond well to ketamine therapy.

### The Primary Indication: Treatment-Resistant Depression

Ketamine has the strongest evidence base for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), typically defined as depression that hasn't responded to at least two adequate trials of traditional antidepressants.

**Signs you might have treatment-resistant depression:**
- You've tried multiple antidepressants with limited or no benefit
- Medications helped initially but stopped working
- Side effects have prevented adequate trials of medications
- You've been in therapy for years with limited progress
- Your depression has lasted for years with only partial remission

If this describes you, ketamine may offer a genuinely different approach worth exploring.

### Other Conditions with Evidence

Beyond treatment-resistant depression, ketamine has shown promise for:

**Bipolar depression** — The depressive phase of bipolar disorder, with appropriate precautions
**Suicidal ideation** — Particularly when rapid reduction of suicidal thoughts is critical
**PTSD** — Emerging evidence, especially for treatment-resistant cases
**Anxiety disorders** — Mixed evidence; some patients report significant benefit
**Chronic pain conditions** — CRPS, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain
**OCD** — Preliminary research suggests potential benefit

### Ideal Candidate Characteristics

Beyond diagnosis, certain characteristics suggest you might respond well:

**Medical stability:**
- No uncontrolled high blood pressure
- No active cardiac disease
- No conditions that make ketamine risky

**Psychological readiness:**
- Openness to unconventional experiences
- Willingness to engage in therapy alongside treatment
- Realistic expectations about what ketamine can and can't do
- Support system in place

**Treatment history:**
- Have given traditional treatments adequate trials
- Have engaged genuinely in psychotherapy
- Are not early in the treatment process (ketamine usually isn't first-line)

**Commitment to the process:**
- Able to commit to a series of treatments
- Willing to engage in integration work
- Have practical logistics (transportation, time off work) figured out

## Who Should Not Pursue Ketamine?

Some conditions and situations make ketamine inadvisable or require extreme caution.

### Medical Contraindications

**Absolute or near-absolute contraindications:**

- **Uncontrolled hypertension**: Ketamine raises blood pressure; uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases risk
- **Unstable cardiac disease**: Recent heart attack, unstable angina, severe heart failure
- **Active aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation**: Risk of rupture with blood pressure changes
- **Pregnancy**: Safety not established; generally avoided
- **Known ketamine allergy**: Rare but serious
- **Active substance abuse**: Current problematic use of alcohol or drugs (ketamine has abuse potential)

**Relative contraindications (require careful evaluation):**

- Controlled hypertension (may be manageable with monitoring)
- Stable cardiac conditions (case-by-case basis)
- Liver disease (ketamine is metabolized by liver)
- Glaucoma (ketamine may increase eye pressure)
- Hyperthyroidism (interacts with cardiovascular effects)

### Psychiatric Contraindications

**High-risk psychiatric conditions:**

- **Active psychosis or schizophrenia**: Ketamine can worsen psychotic symptoms
- **History of psychotic episodes**: Even if currently stable, significant risk
- **Severe dissociative disorders**: Ketamine's dissociative effects may be destabilizing
- **Active mania or rapid-cycling bipolar**: Risk of triggering manic episodes

**Conditions requiring careful evaluation:**

- History of hallucinations or paranoia
- Borderline personality disorder (mixed findings; some protocols exclude, others include with support)
- Severe anxiety or panic (ketamine experience might be difficult)
- Active eating disorder (some concerns about weight effects)

### Situational Considerations

Beyond medical and psychiatric factors, consider:

**Active substance use issues:**
- Current alcohol use disorder
- Current drug abuse or dependence
- History of ketamine abuse specifically
- Risk of using ketamine outside medical settings

**Inadequate support:**
- No reliable transportation to/from appointments
- No support person available for treatment days
- Chaotic living situation
- Active crisis that needs immediate attention

**Unrealistic expectations:**
- Expecting ketamine to be a "magic cure"
- Unwilling to engage in therapy or lifestyle changes
- Seeking ketamine to avoid dealing with underlying issues
- Previous "doctor shopping" or medication-seeking behavior

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Honest self-reflection is crucial. Consider these questions:

### About Your Treatment History

- Have I given traditional antidepressants a genuine chance (adequate dose for adequate time)?
- Have I been honest with my doctors about my symptoms and medication compliance?
- Have I engaged meaningfully in psychotherapy, not just attended sessions?
- Am I seeking ketamine because other treatments failed, or because I want a shortcut?

### About Your Expectations

- Do I understand that ketamine is a tool, not a cure?
- Am I prepared for the possibility that ketamine might not work for me?
- Can I commit to the full treatment process, including integration work?
- Am I willing to make lifestyle changes to support my mental health?

### About Your Readiness

- Am I in a stable enough place to handle an intense experience?
- Do I have support people who can help me through this process?
- Can I take time off work and handle the practical logistics?
- Am I doing this for myself, or to please others?

### About Your Health

- Have I been honest with providers about my full medical history?
- Am I willing to undergo necessary medical screening?
- Will I disclose all substances I use, including alcohol and cannabis?
- Am I willing to follow pre-treatment instructions (fasting, medication adjustments)?
