# Is Ketamine Therapy Right for You? A Decision-Making Guide

Deciding whether to pursue ketamine therapy is a deeply personal decision—one that deserves careful thought, honest self-assessment, and guidance from qualified healthcare providers. This isn't a treatment to pursue casually, but for the right candidates, it can be genuinely transformative.

This guide will help you think through whether ketamine might be appropriate for your situation. It's not a substitute for professional evaluation, but it can help you have a more informed conversation with your healthcare providers and make a decision you feel confident about.

## Who Typically Benefits from Ketamine?

Research and clinical experience have identified profiles of patients who tend to respond well to ketamine therapy.

### The Primary Indication: Treatment-Resistant Depression

Ketamine has the strongest evidence base for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), typically defined as depression that hasn't responded to at least two adequate trials of traditional antidepressants.

**Signs you might have treatment-resistant depression:**
- You've tried multiple antidepressants with limited or no benefit
- Medications helped initially but stopped working
- Side effects have prevented adequate trials of medications
- You've been in therapy for years with limited progress
- Your depression has lasted for years with only partial remission

If this describes you, ketamine may offer a genuinely different approach worth exploring.

### Other Conditions with Evidence

Beyond treatment-resistant depression, ketamine has shown promise for:

**Bipolar depression** — The depressive phase of bipolar disorder, with appropriate precautions

**Suicidal ideation** — Particularly when rapid reduction of suicidal thoughts is critical

**PTSD** — Emerging evidence, especially for treatment-resistant cases. Learn more: [PTSD and Ketamine: What the Trauma Research Shows](/blog/ptsd-ketamine-trauma-research)

**Anxiety disorders** — Mixed evidence; some patients report significant benefit

**Chronic pain conditions** — CRPS, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain. See: [Ketamine for Chronic Pain: Clinical Applications](/blog/chronic-pain-ketamine-applications)

**OCD** — Preliminary research suggests potential benefit

### Ideal Candidate Characteristics

Beyond diagnosis, certain characteristics suggest you might respond well:

**Medical stability:**
- No uncontrolled high blood pressure
- No active cardiac disease
- No conditions that make ketamine risky

**Psychological readiness:**
- Openness to unconventional experiences
- Willingness to engage in therapy alongside treatment
- Realistic expectations about what ketamine can and can't do
- Support system in place

**Treatment history:**
- Have given traditional treatments adequate trials
- Have engaged genuinely in psychotherapy
- Are not early in the treatment process (ketamine usually isn't first-line)

**Commitment to the process:**
- Able to commit to a series of treatments
- Willing to engage in integration work
- Have practical logistics (transportation, time off work) figured out

## Who Should Not Pursue Ketamine?

Some conditions and situations make ketamine inadvisable or require extreme caution.

### Medical Contraindications

**Absolute or near-absolute contraindications:**

- **Uncontrolled hypertension**: Ketamine raises blood pressure; uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases risk
- **Unstable cardiac disease**: Recent heart attack, unstable angina, severe heart failure
- **Active aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation**: Risk of rupture with blood pressure changes
- **Pregnancy**: Safety not established; generally avoided
- **Known ketamine allergy**: Rare but serious
- **Active substance abuse**: Current problematic use of alcohol or drugs (ketamine has abuse potential)

**Relative contraindications (require careful evaluation):**

- Controlled hypertension (may be manageable with monitoring)
- Stable cardiac conditions (case-by-case basis)
- Liver disease (ketamine is metabolized by liver)
- Glaucoma (ketamine may increase eye pressure)
- Hyperthyroidism (interacts with cardiovascular effects)

### Psychiatric Contraindications

**High-risk psychiatric conditions:**

- **Active psychosis or schizophrenia**: Ketamine can worsen psychotic symptoms
- **History of psychotic episodes**: Even if currently stable, significant risk
- **Severe dissociative disorders**: Ketamine's dissociative effects may be destabilizing
- **Active mania or rapid-cycling bipolar**: Risk of triggering manic episodes

**Conditions requiring careful evaluation:**

- History of hallucinations or paranoia
- Borderline personality disorder (mixed findings; some protocols exclude, others include with support)
- Severe anxiety or panic (ketamine experience might be difficult)
- Active eating disorder (some concerns about weight effects)

### Situational Considerations

Beyond medical and psychiatric factors, consider:

**Active substance use issues:**
- Current alcohol use disorder
- Current drug abuse or dependence
- History of ketamine abuse specifically
- Risk of using ketamine outside medical settings

**Inadequate support:**
- No reliable transportation to/from appointments
- No support person available for treatment days
- Chaotic living situation
- Active crisis that needs immediate attention

**Unrealistic expectations:**
- Expecting ketamine to be a "magic cure"
- Unwilling to engage in therapy or lifestyle changes
- Seeking ketamine to avoid dealing with underlying issues
- Previous "doctor shopping" or medication-seeking behavior

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Honest self-reflection is crucial. Consider these questions:

### About Your Treatment History

- Have I given traditional antidepressants a genuine chance (adequate dose for adequate time)?
- Have I been honest with my doctors about my symptoms and medication compliance?
- Have I engaged meaningfully in psychotherapy, not just attended sessions?
- Am I seeking ketamine because other treatments failed, or because I want a shortcut?

- Rapid relief from depression symptoms (hours to days)
- Reduction in suicidal thoughts
- Increased capacity to engage in therapy
- A window of neuroplasticity for making positive changes
- Hope and motivation restored
- Improved functioning at work and in relationships

**For the right candidates:**
- 50-70% response rates (treatment-resistant patients)
- Effects often begin within 24-72 hours
- Some patients achieve lasting remission

### Potential Risks and Downsides

**Medical risks:**

- You haven't adequately tried other treatments
- You have medical or psychiatric contraindications
- You're expecting a magic cure without effort
- You're in active substance abuse
- You lack support or practical resources
- You're primarily motivated by curiosity rather than therapeutic need

**You might want to wait if:**
- You're in acute crisis that needs immediate stabilization
- Your life situation is too chaotic to engage properly

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to have tried other medications before ketamine?

Ketamine is typically recommended for "treatment-resistant" depression, which generally means you haven't responded adequately to at least two different antidepressant medications at appropriate doses for adequate time (usually 6-8 weeks each). However, in some cases—such as severe suicidal ideation or situations where rapid response is critical—providers may consider ketamine earlier.

### Can I take ketamine if I have anxiety?

Many patients with anxiety alongside depression do receive ketamine treatment. However, the dissociative experience can be challenging for people with severe anxiety. Good providers will assess your anxiety level, may start with lower doses, and will prepare you for what to expect. Some patients find that ketamine actually helps their anxiety significantly.

### Is ketamine safe if I have a history of substance abuse?

This requires careful evaluation. Active substance abuse is generally a contraindication. However, people in stable recovery may be candidates with appropriate safeguards. You should be completely honest with your provider about your substance use history. Some providers specialize in treating patients with co-occurring depression and substance use disorders.

### How do I know if my depression is "treatment-resistant" enough for ketamine?

Generally, if you've tried at least two different antidepressants from different classes, at adequate doses, for at least 6-8 weeks each, without achieving remission, your depression may be considered treatment-resistant. Your provider can help assess whether you meet these criteria. Be honest about whether previous trials were truly adequate (right dose, long enough, taken consistently).

### What if I'm not sure ketamine is right for me?

It's okay to be uncertain. You can schedule an evaluation consultation without committing to treatment. This gives you the opportunity to ask questions, learn more about what's involved, and make an informed decision. Many people find that talking with a ketamine provider helps clarify whether it's the right choice for them.
