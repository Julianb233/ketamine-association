# Ketamine in Special Populations: Considerations for Elderly and Adolescent Patients

The expanding use of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression and other psychiatric conditions has prompted clinicians to consider its application across a broader demographic spectrum. While the majority of clinical trials have focused on adults aged 18-65, the burden of treatment-resistant depression affects patients at both ends of the age continuum. Elderly patients often present with decades of medication trials and significant medical comorbidities, while adolescents face a mental health crisis with limited FDA-approved options. This article examines the evidence, protocols, and practical considerations for ketamine administration in these special populations.

## Part I: Geriatric Considerations

### The Scope of Late-Life Depression

Late-life depression affects approximately 15-20% of adults over age 65 and is associated with significant morbidity, including cognitive decline, functional impairment, and increased mortality. Treatment resistance is particularly common in this population, with estimates suggesting that 30-40% of elderly patients fail to achieve remission with conventional antidepressants.

The challenges of treating geriatric depression include:

- **Polypharmacy concerns**: The average elderly patient takes 5-7 medications, creating complex interaction potential
- **Medical comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal impairment affect drug metabolism and safety
- **Cognitive vulnerability**: Distinguishing depression from early dementia, and concerns about treatment-related cognitive effects
- **Altered pharmacokinetics**: Age-related changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination

### Pharmacological Considerations in the Elderly

#### Pharmacokinetic Changes

Age-related physiological changes significantly impact ketamine pharmacology:

**Reduced Hepatic Metabolism**: Ketamine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 enzymes. Hepatic blood flow decreases by approximately 40% between ages 25 and 65, potentially prolonging ketamine's half-life and increasing exposure to both parent compound and metabolites (Zanos et al., 2018).

**Altered Body Composition**: Increased adipose tissue and decreased lean body mass in elderly patients affect volume of distribution. Ketamine's lipophilic properties may lead to prolonged tissue storage and slower elimination.

**Renal Function Decline**: While ketamine itself is not primarily renally eliminated, its metabolites are. Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may lead to metabolite accumulation with repeated dosing.

**Protein Binding**: Reduced serum albumin in elderly patients increases free drug fraction, potentially intensifying effects at standard doses.

#### Recommended Dosing Adjustments

Based on pharmacokinetic considerations and emerging clinical data, the following adjustments are recommended for patients over 65:

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Geriatric Adjustment |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Initial IV dose | 0.5 mg/kg | 0.3-0.4 mg/kg |
| Infusion rate | Over 40 min | Over 50-60 min |
| Intranasal dose | 56-84 mg | 56 mg initially |
| Treatment frequency | 2x weekly | 1-2x weekly with extended monitoring |

### Cardiovascular Considerations

Ketamine's sympathomimetic effects present particular concerns in the elderly population:

**Blood Pressure Response**: Elderly patients may exhibit exaggerated hypertensive responses due to decreased baroreceptor sensitivity and arterial compliance. Studies indicate that patients over 65 experience mean systolic blood pressure increases of 25-35 mmHg, compared to 15-25 mmHg in younger adults (Riva-Posse et al., 2018).

**Cardiac Workload**: Increased heart rate and blood pressure transiently elevate myocardial oxygen demand. In patients with coronary artery disease, this may be clinically significant.

**Pre-Treatment Assessment Protocol**:

1. Baseline ECG for all patients over 65
2. Cardiac stress testing or clearance for patients with known CAD or multiple risk factors
3. Blood pressure optimization (target <140/90) before initiating treatment
4. Hold antihypertensives on treatment day only if hypotension risk exceeds hypertension risk

**Intra-Treatment Monitoring**:

- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Blood pressure every 5-10 minutes during infusion
- Continuous cardiac monitoring for patients with cardiac history
- Extended post-infusion monitoring (minimum 90 minutes)

### Cognitive Effects and Dementia Risk

A significant concern among geriatric psychiatrists is ketamine's potential cognitive impact in already vulnerable elderly patients.

**Acute Cognitive Effects**: Dissociative symptoms may be more pronounced and prolonged in elderly patients. Emergence phenomena, while typically brief, can cause significant distress in patients with baseline cognitive impairment.

**Long-Term Cognitive Considerations**: Current evidence does not suggest that therapeutic ketamine accelerates cognitive decline. A 2023 prospective study of 78 elderly patients receiving maintenance ketamine found no significant changes in MOCA scores over 12 months (Lenze et al., 2023). However, patients with pre-existing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) should be monitored carefully.

**Practical Recommendations**:

- Baseline cognitive screening (MOCA or MMSE) before initiating treatment
- Serial cognitive assessments every 3-6 months during maintenance therapy
- Lower doses and slower titration in patients with MCI
- Consider excluding patients with moderate-to-severe dementia

### Clinical Evidence in Elderly Populations

While randomized controlled trial data specifically in elderly populations remains limited, several studies inform clinical practice:

**Ochs-Ross et al. (2020)**: In a post-hoc analysis of the TRANSFORM-3 trial, esketamine nasal spray demonstrated efficacy in patients 65 and older, though effect sizes were smaller than in younger cohorts. Notably, adverse events were not significantly increased.

**George et al. (2017)**: An open-label study of IV ketamine in 16 patients over 60 with treatment-resistant depression showed response rates of 43% and remission rates of 25%, comparable to younger populations.

**Lenze et al. (2020)**: This pilot study of 20 elderly patients demonstrated that lower-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) produced antidepressant effects with improved tolerability compared to standard dosing.

## Part II: Adolescent Considerations

### The Adolescent Mental Health Crisis

The mental health of adolescents has reached crisis proportions, with depression rates more than doubling over the past decade. Suicide is now the second leading cause of death among individuals aged 10-24. Despite this urgent need, treatment options remain limited:

- Only two antidepressants (fluoxetine and escitalopram) are FDA-approved for adolescent depression
- Response rates to conventional treatments are approximately 50-60%
- Treatment-resistant depression in adolescents is associated with significant long-term morbidity

### Current Evidence for Ketamine in Adolescents

The evidence base for ketamine in adolescents is growing but remains limited compared to adult data:

**Dwyer et al. (2021)**: A systematic review identified 12 studies examining ketamine in pediatric/adolescent populations for depression or suicidal ideation. While most were small or retrospective, consistent signals of efficacy emerged with acceptable safety profiles.

**Cullen et al. (2018)**: In a small randomized crossover trial of 13 adolescents with treatment-resistant depression, a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg) produced significant reductions in depression scores compared to midazolam control. Effects were evident at 24 hours but not sustained at day 14.

**Zarate et al. (2024)**: A larger randomized trial of 60 adolescents demonstrated that six IV ketamine infusions over two weeks produced sustained antidepressant effects, with 47% of patients meeting response criteria at week 4.

### Developmental Considerations

#### Neurobiological Factors

The adolescent brain is undergoing significant developmental changes that may influence ketamine's effects:

**Glutamate System Development**: The glutamatergic system continues maturing through adolescence, with NMDA receptor expression and function evolving. This may result in different dose-response relationships compared to adults.

**Prefrontal Cortex Development**: Ongoing prefrontal development raises theoretical concerns about repeated NMDA receptor blockade. However, preclinical studies have not demonstrated neurotoxicity at therapeutic doses, and some research suggests potential neuroprotective effects.

**Neuroplasticity**: The heightened neuroplasticity of the adolescent brain may enhance ketamine's antidepressant mechanisms, potentially leading to more robust or sustained responses.

#### Psychological Factors

Adolescents experience dissociative effects differently than adults:

- May be more prone to anxiety during dissociative states
- Peer influences and social context significantly impact treatment experience
- Developmental stage affects capacity for informed consent and treatment engagement

### Dosing in Adolescents

Weight-based dosing is standard, though consideration should be given to developmental factors:

| Age Group | Initial IV Dose | Maximum Dose | Infusion Duration |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 13-15 years | 0.3-0.4 mg/kg | 0.5 mg/kg | 40-60 minutes |
| 16-17 years | 0.4-0.5 mg/kg | 0.5 mg/kg | 40 minutes |

**Important Considerations**:

- Start conservatively and titrate based on response and tolerability
- Allow longer intervals between sessions initially to assess response
- Intranasal esketamine (Spravato) is not FDA-approved for patients under 18

### Risk/Benefit Analysis Framework

Given the limited data and developmental concerns, a rigorous risk/benefit analysis is essential before treating adolescents:

**Factors Favoring Treatment**:
- Severe, treatment-resistant depression after adequate trials of conventional treatments
- Acute suicidal ideation requiring rapid intervention
- Failed or unable to tolerate ECT
- Strong family support and adherence capacity
- Research setting with appropriate oversight

**Factors Against Treatment**:
- Mild-to-moderate depression responsive to other treatments
- Active substance use disorder
- History of psychotic symptoms
- Inability to provide informed assent
- Inadequate family support or monitoring capacity

### Informed Consent and Assent

Ethical treatment of adolescents requires attention to both legal requirements and developmental capacity:

**Parental Consent**: Legally required for patients under 18 in most jurisdictions. Parents should receive comprehensive education about:
- Evidence base (including limitations)
- Potential risks and benefits
- Alternative treatments
- Unknown long-term effects

**Adolescent Assent**: Meaningful participation in treatment decisions is essential:
- Age-appropriate explanation of treatment
- Opportunity to ask questions privately
- Assessment of understanding
- Respect for expressed concerns

**Documentation**: Detailed documentation should include:
- Prior treatment trials and outcomes
- Rationale for ketamine consideration
- Risk/benefit discussion
- Both parent consent and adolescent assent

### Family Involvement

Family engagement is critical in adolescent ketamine treatment:

**Pre-Treatment Family Education**:
- What to expect during and after sessions
- How to support the adolescent at home
- Warning signs requiring contact
- Importance of complementary therapies

**Treatment Day Protocols**:
- Parent presence during infusion (if desired by adolescent)
- Private time with clinician for adolescent
- Post-treatment family debriefing

**Ongoing Family Therapy**: Ketamine should be integrated with family-based interventions addressing:
- Communication patterns
- Parental mental health
- Family stressors
- Developmental transitions

## Part III: Implementation Framework

### Building Special Population Protocols

Clinics serving special populations should develop comprehensive protocols addressing:

**Screening and Assessment**:
- Age-specific screening tools
- Medical clearance requirements
- Cognitive assessment protocols
- Family assessment (for adolescents)

**Treatment Delivery**:
- Dosing algorithms
- Monitoring parameters
- Staff training requirements
- Emergency protocols

**Follow-Up and Maintenance**:
- Assessment schedules
- Criteria for continuation/discontinuation
- Integration with other treatments
- Long-term safety monitoring

### Staff Training Considerations

Treating special populations requires additional competencies:

**Geriatric Care**:
- Recognition and management of delirium
- Cardiovascular emergency response
- Communication with patients with sensory or cognitive impairment
- Coordination with geriatric medicine colleagues

**Adolescent Care**:
- Developmental psychology fundamentals
- Adolescent-specific communication skills
- Family therapy basics
- Mandatory reporting requirements
- Youth-friendly environment creation

### Quality Metrics

Track outcomes specific to these populations:

**Geriatric Metrics**:
- Cardiovascular events
- Falls or injuries
- Cognitive changes
- Functional status changes

**Adolescent Metrics**:
- Suicidal ideation (C-SSRS)
- School attendance and performance
- Family functioning
- Substance use monitoring

## Strategic Takeaways

1. **Start Low, Go Slow**: Both populations benefit from conservative initial dosing with careful titration. Elderly patients typically require 20-40% dose reductions; adolescents should start at the lower end of weight-based ranges.

2. **Extend Monitoring**: Prolonged observation periods are warranted—minimum 90 minutes for elderly patients and enhanced cardiovascular monitoring for those with risk factors.

3. **Involve Families Appropriately**: Family engagement is essential for adolescents and often valuable for elderly patients. Develop structured protocols for family education and involvement.

4. **Document Rigorously**: Given the off-label nature of treatment in adolescents and increased medical complexity in the elderly, comprehensive documentation protects both patients and practitioners.

5. **Track Long-Term Outcomes**: Establish systematic follow-up protocols to monitor for delayed adverse effects and contribute to the evidence base for these populations.

6. **Integrate with Comprehensive Care**: Ketamine should complement, not replace, evidence-based psychotherapy and appropriate pharmacotherapy. Care coordination with geriatricians, pediatricians, and family therapists enhances outcomes.

7. **Stay Current**: The evidence base for both populations is rapidly evolving. Commit to ongoing education and protocol refinement as new data emerge.

8. **Consider Research Participation**: Given limited data, consider referring appropriate patients to clinical trials or establishing your own research protocols to advance the field.
